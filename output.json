  "review": [
    "I can’t with this one. It’s too invasive and in your face. At first I thought I liked it and then a few minutes after wearing this on my hand I realized I in fact did not like this and after washing my hand 3 times, it’s still radiating off my hand. This is the Michael Myers of fragrances, it just won’t die. The fruitiness is overly synthetic and headache inducing.",
    "She's gorgeous. Fruity with a touch of spice, and long lasting. Perfect for the office!",
    "This is my rave scent. I love it so much. It gives me energy, and for me it is just perfect, for all night raving. I don't wear it anywhere else. ❤😎",
    "I loved this for so long. Maybe I never realized - One day I wore it to watch my girlfriend play hockey (slightly oversprayed as it was hot outside) and a few passerby’s mentioned that it reeked of bleach while they all circled around and agreed then realized it was me. I had to apologize and it was just pure embarrassment on both ends. I haven’t reached for it since, one may say not to care what others think but I don’t want to walk around smelling like the janitor sitting in the supply closet having his fruit salad. As one has explained to me before… It has turned into a vacation scent for me now. I still like it but if someone thinks I reek at least if i am on vacation they don’t speak English to tell me.",
    "i really, really love this fragrance. the citrus and musky dry-down is fabulous. it's really strong and the projection is great aswell. have gotten compliments from this. it was a summer staple for me until i drained it",
    "So overrated and mid. You wanna smell like a banana smoothie with sweet be my guest.",
    "Diğer meyve sepeti.",
    "zesty basket of ripe fruits",
    "Was over hyped, now over hated. It’s a very nice clean fruity scent that performs well. It’s really good. Unisex.",
    "super easy to like, it smelled quite artificial but in a very good way. my first thought was that i was smelling body wash, some nice 5+ euros body wash that you can get at the supermarket, nothing more, nothing less, but that projects and lasts for a very long time, i can't say i love it, but its super safe and super good smelling",
    "Complexity: 2 Longevity: 3 Radiance: 3 Occasion: 3 Season: 5 Overall: 3.2 I’ve had to go back to this review. You’ll either love it or hate it. I hate it. Sickly sweet scent with, maybe, a touch of floral with minty mouthwash thrown in. Longevity not as good as other Xerjoff’s.",
    "My first niche, will never forget smelling this for the first time and maniplualting my self due to the price tag to thinking this was good . Beast mode longevetiy and projection. Unfornatantley this was way too femenine for my liking. The smell however is great. If you can pull this off then do not hesitate",
    "Totally sucks smell so strong and bad",
    "Seriously, I HATE this. I know - hate is a very strong emotion but I mean it. This fragrance makes me absolutely angry and disgusted. I can't stand this s**t. All I can smell is crazy artificial fruit with aggressive musk. When I read other reviews saying about wonderful fruit and vanilla I'm genuinely like WTF? Projection is INSANE! Lasts forever. I hope that hype for this is going to die anytime soon. Seriously it's a torture to be around Erba Pura.",
    "I'd like to talk about the Xerjoff line in general because I noticed something very annoying with these perfumes. At first they have an intoxicating, rich, fresh, sexy and balanced smell to them, but once those top notes – the citrus, orange, herbs, fruit etc. – disappear these fragrances change drastically. What I can smell after half an hour are the same, almost uniform masculine-leaning base notes of a synthetic-smelling musky, stale, gigolo smell that I don't want to smell on myself as a woman. On men, these base notes might come across as seductive but let me tell you I tried a lot of these perfumes on a paper strip and they all dried down into this unpleasant, unbalanced, bitter scent. Except for maybe Alexandria II, thanks to the excessive amount of woody notes, and Golden Dallah which to me smelled like christmas rum punch due to the fruits, sweet notes and spices in it.",
    "Unfortunately, this smells like a dirty, neglected animal stall (as a student I went to the zoo and the tapir den smelled just like it) sprinkled with sweat and pickle brine to me. This impression is so strong, that it drowns out any pleasantness that this fragrance might have. It's also obnoxiously loud, like the towns drunkard stumbling down the main road at 3 AM in the morning screaming at the top of his lungs, and with its current popularity it's more like an entire parade of town drunkards marching through town. Very unfortunate fragrance.",
    "Smells good when you smell it for the first time, but after that it's just a pure synthetic musk bomb that reeks. Way too overhyped, way too worn, way too many dupes. I smell this every single day I go out and that disgusting synthetic musk turns my stomach upside down. Yes it's unique. Yes it was something special when it came out. But now with all the dupes and all the hype it's just too much. And if any perfume taught me that crazy strength does not mean it's a good perfume, it's this.",
    "this was the fragrance that got me into Xerjoff a year ago. a very beautiful and vibrant fruity vanilla scent. it's like a toned down version of Paco Rabanne's 1 million",
    "Mediterranean Mirage is a dupe in case you are curious about this fragrance and thankfully so, you don't have to waste money",
    "Its one of the worst fragrances ever",
    "I was overseas in Eastern Europe and I smelled so much of this perfume dna on men. I don't know who finds it attractive, it hurt my nose every time I picked up the trail of the scent. Sharp, loud, unpleasant.",
    "Personally, Erba Pura is my go-to wear 1-2 sprays is enough for 10+ hours of longevity I understand all the hype and its definitely worth a gate keep. Also the huzz love it",
    "I didn’t think I could keep redefining my personal idea of “perplexity,” but it seems to happen more and more often (not always, but often) whenever I try niche fragrances that are heavily hyped. Of course, there’s always the factor of how a scent reacts on one’s own skin — but on me, Erba Pura doesn’t give me anything “fresh,” and very little that feels genuinely citrusy. What I get is basically an indistinct mishmash of fake, hyper-sweet fruits. Maybe that’s my limitation, but I honestly can’t wrap my head around some of the things I see written in earlier reviews. To my nose, a fragrance like this might only appeal to a teenager still using those old-school multicolor pens with scented inks (green apple, strawberry, pineapple, etc.). That’s exactly what Erba Pura reminds me of: the pens some of my classmates had in middle school. If my partner wore this, I’d politely ask her to take a shower and try again with something more grown-up — and, most importantly, less cloying.",
    "This was oooober hyped up online, and as a fruit lover I've been trying to test this in person for quite some time. Smelled it on paper today, and close up you can smell all the fruits. It's tropical, sweet, and super juicy. But my god, the chemically cologne smell this emits is overpowering. Had to roll down the windows on the car ride home because it was so cologney and ripe. If the musk was toned down this would be an instant buy, but the fruits are smothered by that synthetic smell. Had to begrudgingly wash it off and yet it's still lingering.",
    "Haven't smelled this one, but keep seeing BBW's new Mediterranean Mirage is a close, long-lasting dupe.",
    "Erba pura مصنف للجنسين لكن رائحته نسائية لم ترق لي يناسب الكثير من المناسبات أبرزها تلك الفسحات على شاطئ البحر في جو بارد او معتدل لايصلح في الجو الحار .",
    "I 💚 everything about this deliciously fruity perfume. I'm not getting the \"it's too musky\" smell that so many people complain about. It's just wonderful. I could not see a man wearing this...It's feminine to me. A low-cost option for a similar scent is Philos Pura by Maison Alhambra; it is a very good one to try for sure. It is so close to the OG imo.",
    "Gummy bears. 6/10",
    "I have a full bottle only sprayed once If anyone wants to buy or trade (I’m LA based but happy to ship). Dm me. Not interested in designer or budget fragrances",
    "I personally can't stand this fragrance. Objectively it's an unbelievably strong and persistent fruity and fresh summer scent, which is rare and remarkable. Too bad that for me it is an obnoxious, loud, pungent chemical bomb, that doesn't smell like fruits at all. To make it worse there's something about this fragrance that smells so unexplainably old, like a note of old lady or hospital somehow. 6/10",
    "Personal: 9/10 – I don't usually like loud, syrupy, super synthetic bottles, but I actually do really enjoy this one for some reason. It's the exception to the rule. Mass appeal: 9/10 – Candy-sweet fruity bombs are very likable, even if a bit juvenile. Compliment puller. Iconic and well loved for a reason. Performance: 9/10 – Nuclear. It lasts as long as you'd expect something to loud and syrupy to last. It doesn't disappoint. Value: 7/10 - Xerjoff's price tag hurts, and there are much cheaper designers that are somewhat similar, and clones that are cheap, but you'll never get THIS. Uniqueness: 6.5/10 – Fruity candy bombs aren’t new, but this one is polished and amplified. Not entirely unique, but it's unique enough. SCORE: 81/100 Full bottle buy? YES, but I would get bored of it pretty quickly. Blind buy? NO, unless you know you love loud, syrupy sweet fruity scents. Recommend? YES, if you want a fruity niche beast with massive projection. Date night? YES, it’s flirty, fun, and sweet enough to impress in casual settings. Office safe? NO, unless you want to fumigate the whole office with mango Skittles. Pros: Extremely loud, long-lasting, juicy fruity fun. Compliment magnet. Cons: A bit synthetic and cloying if oversprayed. It's pricey. You won't be the only one wearing it. Erba Pura is a true fruit salad sugar bomb. It's syrupy, extremely sweet, very loud, and it makes sure you know if you're wearing it, or if someone else is. It projects very well and lasts for a long time. There are clones out there that get you 85% of the way there, Ana Abiyedh is one of the most notable to me, but no clone will ever get that fruity, juicy, candy like vibe that Erba Pura demonstrates. It's unique enough, but what it does is be loud without being annoying. If oversprayed, for sure, but with a couple sprays it does its job and won't gas the entire room out. This isn't my usual cup of tea, but for some reason, I'm drawn to Erba Pura specifically over almost all other juicy syrupy fruit fragrances. It's designer-esque but with enough uniqueness to stand out from designer alternatives, and a distinctly unisex appeal that similar designers don't have. For me, it's an enjoyable sniff, but I don't think I could pull off wearing it frequently. It doesn't quite fit my darker vibe, but during the summertime, it might work just fine. I couldn't pull off a full 100ml bottle, but maybe I'll have to get a 50, just so I can wear it when the time is right. Review #96 in my fragrance journey – this fragrance I own as a decant",
    "i hate this fragrance, its so bad, its so annoying, its very bad, i hate it, i hate it, i hate it. Smells like some bad rotten moldy ugly fruit. boiii i dont wanna smell like that like what the frick",
    "Juicy synthetic fruits. I sometimes wear it. Not good daily, if it’s your signature and u wear it indoors I might start secretly hate you or saying stuff aloud like “ what’s that stench “ “ omg did someone bring rotten fruits “ even tho it’s not that, and I quite like it but it just doesn’t work in work environment.",
    "I wanted to like this but it’s just offensive and headache inducing. The musk cuts through the top notes and it was a scrubber for me.",
    "Bought a felt bottle for a good price for my girlfriend, but this thing is so good we share it now. Fresh, bright, citrusy fruits on a bed of clean laundered musk and creamy vanilla. It is loud and can be hard to pull off, but its fantastic as a layering option. Be careful with sprays, be mindful of occasion. Smells more like a bona fide vacation fragrance. Try this at SpritzTheWorldDotNet",
    "Musky, fruity, citrusy perfume. This is so beautiful. Although this is unisex I loved to wear this. I wouldn't buy it again since I am more of a sweet gourmand girlie. This doesn't leave your skin or hair once you spray it on. Monster performance.",
    "I can see why people like Erba Pura, but for me it is a nightmare. The fruit is juicy, bright, and actually really nice, but then the musk comes crashing in and ruins everything. On my skin it turns into something that smells like the fruit has been left out too long, overripe and rotting. It was so unpleasant I genuinely had to shower it off. Love the fruit, absolutely hate the musk. I only had a decant, but even that reminded me of the original felt bottles, which were fantastic. Why they ditched that design for basic painted glass I will never understand. For the price Xerjoff ask, they should have kept the felt. At least then I would have enjoyed looking at the bottle, even if I could never stand to wear what is inside it.",
    "No mango in this one!! That comes directly from Xerjoff corporate!!",
    "It should be noted first of all that I bought the edition with the velvet bottle, and it is definitely impressive, the whole presentation is admirable. Regarding the smell - I am very disappointed.. A very strong synthetic smell of fruits and cheap synthetic \"musk\".. I expected much, much more for the price A plus point is that the perfume lasts a very long time and also radiates excellently. In conclusion - a perfume for collectors, yes A perfume just for the smell? Only if you really like it",
    "Disappointed. Smells like nothing to me. Just there. I was very excited to try it. It has all the notes I love. Makes me sad.",
    "I believe they forget to include the rest of ingredients on mine bottle. Mine just smell to Ambroxan middle note Ambroxan and Ambroxan",
    "A synthetically smelling fruit basket that lasts 12+ hours and projects like crazy. I love it although it’s definitely divisive.",
    "sweet & synthetically fruity :/ i wish it smelled more like real fruit but im ok with the fruity candy smell ngl. maybe it’ll grow on me more",
    "I'd like to confirm what @eaudemale has already suggested twice: this is a dupe for Britney Spears (Midnight) Fantasy. Al Rehab's Midnight is also a very close alternative for an even cheaper cost. You're welcome.",
    "Podem falar o que quiserem, mas a verdade e' que este perfume e' uma maquina de elogios ! Nao e' a toa ter o Hype Mundial que tem e possuir uma fragrancia facil de agradar. O fato de ter uma fixacao e projecao absurda, tambem faz que seu valor $ seja honesto. Perfume Italiano de altissima qualidade ! Fragrancia: 9/10 Fixacao: 10/10 Projecao: 9/10 Valor-Beneficio: 8/10",
    "i really thought i was going to love this. i’m a fan of fruity frags , one of my favs is tygar. this being fruity i was excited, also hearing it’s projection was insane and longevity for a fruity summer frag. what i got was exactly that, but what i failed to read before buying was that the longevity and projection being so incredible is due to the INCREDIBLY SYNTHETIC smell to it all. it all just isn’t well blended imo, smells headache-inducing. the only way i was able to make this tolerable was with doing 1 spray and 4 of hawas tropical / paradise garden. the minty really helped blend it. but now it’s been traded for torino 22. just really not worth it imo. blind buy with caution as it can be decent in REALLY RARE conditions.",
    "So feminine for a man..",
    "It’s really amazing how polarizing this fragrance is. For me, it just smells really good. It is strong and projects very well all day. Fresh and intoxicating.",
    "It feels way too similar to Tiziana Kirke — almost identical, and definitely far too feminine.",
    "I get a pleasant and simple musky fruity fragrance, but my friend thinks it smells like toilet cleaning products, so...",
    "This message is for women. Please don't use it. It smells too animalic, like an animal and rotten wood. Instead of attracting, it scares them away.",
    "This in my opinion, is the best Xerjoff and one of the best fruity summer fragrances on the market. It starts off very very sweet and fruity with citruses. The drydown is just as good with some musk and vanilla. So good. Its very youthful. I heard its \"zesty\" (Im gen z and chronically online) but I dont get that vibe at all, its perfect if you are a teen! Defintly can wear this all year. Fresh enough for the summer, and sweet enough for winter and fall! 8.9/10 Love this, I need a bottle of this ASAP! EDIT: lowk too strong like 3 sprays MAX and its too syntheitc foir me and people tell me its not good. ill give it 7.9 but gold is better will make review.",
    "It smells gorgeous on paper, but sadly gives chewed old gum on my skin. After 2 hours it dried down to amber and musk, which is nice, I guess fruits in this formula just don’t work well with my chemistry",
    "While I do recognize that fragrance is entirely subjective and each person has their own right of expression, I believe that this fragrance is overhated. To me, this smells like a beautiful, sweet, photorealistic fruit basket with insane projection and sillage. I really want this one in my collection, and it could definitely work as a standalone or layered with a more masculine fragrance. Overall I adore this scent, not blind buy safe though make sure to try it in person.",
    "I tried it on my skin and loved it. It's giving Italian summer in the best way possible. I will be going back to that V Perfumes store to pick this up soon! I can't stop thinking about it. Longevity is impressive, and projection is also very good. At first, I could really smell the lemon, and as it dried down, it got a bit sweeter and muskier.

    "Talk about performance. This things lasts easy 7h and sillage is insane. I had it as a gift from my manager. Strong attractive scent but also mature. Made for those who like explicit presence. Its \"orientalness\" is geniously blended into a complex fruity/powdery/floral ecosystem. Too intense for me but definitely hits hard and leaves a remarkable trace.",
    "After a fairly meh experience following purchase and maceration for 2 months, as a fairly nonchalant male, daytime wear of this will draw attention in any room. It becomes worth the price tag! You can see in real time people around you taking deep whiffs and tracking your movement around the room. Before Maceration, very feminine, After Maceration, fairly unisex for summer sunny day time wear, nighttime would probably confuse people around you",

    "Upon spraying this on my skin it smelled just fine for the first couple minutes, but then...then the smell turned into such a pungent musky synthetically fruity smell reminiscent of sweaty armpits you desparately try to cover up with a fruity deodorant. I guess the only positive thing I can say about this fragrance is it's longevity. Unfortunately for me, the longevity of the fragrance was another downside because no matter how much I scrubbed I could not get this offensive scent off me.",

    "So looking at the scores for Pura & Gold,I'm surprised at the disparity because to my nose these are twins! I'd say Gold was stronger on the vanilla but honestly I'd be surprised if you could tell them apart side by side. Thankfully I only ordered a 10 ml decant of this, I own a 100ml bottle of Gold, you definitely don't need both in your collection.If I was to set them apart I'd say that Pura is the summer version of Gold, personally I wouldn't wear Gold in high heat as it can get a bit cloying.",
    "This isn't any type of musk, this is a synthetic component called ambrocenide which is in fact very cheap which helps to reduce the production cost while still allowing to manufacture those \"powerhouse\" fragrances that fill the room. Unfortunately for us, there are quite a lot of olfactory-impaired individuals who can't detect it in a fragrance which in turn enables these miserly companies to keep getting away with using it. That is also the reason why people say (and genuinely believe) that no one can really hate this and all the hate is undeserved, and why there's no point in trying to argue over this type of fragrance with someone incapable of perceiving it for what it is. What good would it do if you told them ambrocenide smells like formaldehyde, as in, it's its odor profile, not your subjective opinion on it? People will still trust their own nose over you, and they don't care if they walk around smelling like a fruity mortuary as long as they only smell the fruity part. This is the modern perfumery we're stuck with.",
    "I sprayed this perfume on my skin two hours ago and it smelled quite pleasant for the first hour, all fruity and agreeable etc. No noticeable musks for me. Then I took a shower afterwards and now I'm stuck with the sweaty musk. All the fruity notes have been stripped. I'm with the ones who want this type of musk banned on this. It smells cheap and nauseating. Anything with this musk in it will be long lasting obviously.",

This is one of those mass-appealing fragrances where everyone knows a guy that has it, not a bad fragrance, but I'll probably sell my bottle. I don't want to smell like 40% of the male population in the summer. Besides, I think it's a little too synthetic. GO LIGHT ON THE SPRAYS... PLEASE...",

    "Instead of banning natural ingredients because they’re “too allergenic”, IFRA needs to ban whatever synthetic musk is being used this this perfume. The comment below me (@baltep) isn’t getting the point. People don’t hate this fragrance because it’s synthetic. All fruity fragrances are synthetic, since you can’t extract oils from real fruit. People hate this fragrance because it uses that obnoxious sharp musk, that everyone is genuinely tired of smelling. No one actually smells the fruity notes because that musk just overshadows everything, especially in the sillage. If you spray it on your own skin and smell it up-close, yeah you will smell the fruit. But trust me, no one is going to be smelling fruit on you when you wear this. The perfumers decided to taint it with that horrendous sharp musk that you often smell in the sillage of shallow women who douse themselves in perfume every morning. It’s horrible, and probably the biggest cause of headaches in all of perfumery. If you want to be obnoxious and unlikeable, this fragrance is perfect for you.",
    "Erba Pura is beautiful. It doesn’t deserve the hate it gets. The biggest complaint is that it smells synthetic. And yeah, maybe it does, but that doesn’t automatically make it bad. As Jean Giono once said, “If you absolutely insist on the pure, unmixed song of the nightingale, I recommend the synthetic nightingale.” Synthetic doesn’t mean cheap, tacky, or offensive. In this case, it means a stunning fruit accord that’s clean, soft, slightly aldehydic, and reminiscent of fruit skins, particularly peach. As it dries down, the sweet musk blends in perfectly, creating a velvety, airy scent trail that smells exactly like the bottle feels: plush and fuzzy. This doesn’t lean super feminine either. It’s nearly perfectly unisex and wearable for almost any age group, though it tends to resonate more with younger audiences. As we all know, the performance is wild. It stays on clothes for days and projects relentlessly for hours, but thanks to its soft texture, it doesn’t come off aggressive unless you overspray. It’s not for everyone. And especially for guys, this might not be the safest blind buy. I personally prefer Erba Gold, like a lot of people do, but Erba Pura still deserves way more love than it gets. Scent (on skin): 7.5/10 Scent (sillage): 9/10 Projection: 10/10 Longevity: 10/10 Value: 3/10 Originality: 6.5/10 Mass appeal: 7/10 Versatility: 5.5/10",

    "If you like this sort of DNA but want something lighter and more mass appealing, Michael Malul Citizen Jack Parfum. Smelling EP, I was immediately reminded of CJP and I very much prefer CJP. Some things that EP has over CJP though are the longevity and depth (despite that depth being synthetic). Do I see the appeal to EP? Yes, if you are super into fruity, deep, warm fragrances then chances are you'll like EP. But at the pricepoint, I would explore other options. Definitely worth a sniff though",
    "Wanted to love it but it smells a little like a wet rug or something to me. It reminds me of the Commodity line - a mix between Milk & Amber with some fruits thrown in. I can’t say it’s necessarily bad but it is obnoxious and loud for sure, if that’s your thing..",
    "I was excited to review this one after seeing it constantly hyped online. I happened to receive a free sample of it with my recent Fragrancebuy purchase and I unfortunately have to agree with the haters here. It really doesn't smell anything but synthetic. It's almost exactly like opening a bottle of Herbal Essences shampoo and smelling it, except those are 7 bucks and this is 400. It doesn't surprise me as even Xerjoff are ambiguous with the note breakdown listing just \"Mediterranean Fruits\" as a note. It's just messy.",

    "This is so obnoxious, everytime someone wears this my nose feels harassed",
    "Maybe I have a bad sample, but this isn't beast mode. It's a basic popular fragrance where you have a very fruity, sweet scent that under cut a musky undertone. If I had testosterone, this would smell great on me, but I want fruit that smells like fruit.",
    "I've never seen so many mixed opinions on a fragrance comment section ever😭",
    "All you need to know is that I still smell it on my shirt after I have washed it in the washing machine on 30 degrees. Eternal Beast mode.",
    "I don't understand the hate for this scent, sweet and airy with an extremely satisfying to smell drydown. Perfect during the warmer days of the year for both men and women. Soft and not at all synthetic in my opinion, only downside for me is that for such a hefty price the composition is way too simple and lacks the depth in complexity that other niche houses tend to have in similar price points.",
    "I cannot understand why anyone would want to purchase this. It is not pleasant, luxurious, pretty, complex, sexy, or unique. It is only strong, rudely, inappropriately so, and I personally don't understand the reason \"beastmode\" is the top of anyone's fragrance checklist. I smelt this on my uber driver, after many weeks of smelling this everywhere in the UK (migraine after migraine), and he told me what he was wearing. I realised that I had an unopened sample of it in my collection, dabbed a tiny bit on a Post-it for my husband to smell. You guys, it is EVERYWHERE. One pencil eraser-sized dab and my whole house smells like this. My hands, my sofa, the desk where I pulled the post-it. I'm getting fruit, but it's just obvious fake synthetic stank. This is the \"adult\" equivalent of a teenage boy downing themselves in Axe/Lynx. It's just... tacky. And I can understand \"I want to lean into my inner stripper,\" not every perfume has to be classy. But this, this is just unkind to wear in public. Just a massive yikes.",
    "I LOVE Xerjoff Erba Pura!!! It's funny, that I always heard that Naxos was the best Xerjoff fragrance, but that Erba Pura, Alexandria II, and the Tony Iommi fragrances were polarizing and you shouldn't blind buy them, but I think those are all better than Naxos. Naxos was the first Xerjoff fragrance that I tried, after I ordered it from Amazon as a blind buy. It wasn't love at first smell, so I didn't order any more until I got to try them at a fancy mall in Michigan, and I instantly fell in love with Alexandria II, Erba Pura and both Tony Iommi fragrances. Erba Pura has a sweet, intense fruit salad opening, like a bowl of mixed fruits, and it has that signature Xerjoff powdery scent dry down, that I also smell in Alexandria II. I love to layer Erba Pura with Alexandria II, because the fruit really compliments the sweet notes in Alexandria II, and then the powder notes compliment each other and the oud in A2 is amazing to my nose. Xerjoff Erba Pura quickly became one of my favorite fragrances in my collection, and a dumb reach for me. If I'm not sure what fragrance I want to wear, I will often default to Erba Pura. It's pleasant and refreshing and just puts a smile on my face.",
    "It's so OVERHATED, this is such an amazing fragrance, you get fruits, citruses, vanilla and some musk for more depth, on one of the best summer fragrances",
    "Some reviews are just fascinating. Virtually all your fragrances are mostly synthetic compouns. Do people even understand the things they write? Do the meaning of their words even matter? On one hand, this fragrance could have been a win because the scent is sweet and bright. However, it is pungent. Not many occasions on which I would consider wearing it and I definitely wouldn't put it on my skin again. This could have been a fun and delicious scent as it isn't the sickening type of sweet but it is so heavy it suffocates me. People who like overbearing and extremely long lasting creations would absolutely love it. I personally prefer when a fragrance nicely disappears after its use is over. I don't want to actively have to get rid of a scent I am wearing. On the other hand, the sillage is absolutely devine. That's how I even discovered/noticed this fragrance. During a lunch date with a few friends. One of my girls, smelled so good, we kept commenting on it throughout the lunch. And when we were leaving, two girls came to us to ask who was smelling so good and what she was wearing. Even though I personally cannot wear it on me, I adore when she does. It's just so good. All that to say that it's a good scent in the air and it leaves a magnificent trail that follows you for a while. The friend in question gifted me a clone fragrance that is supposedly in the same vain but less aggressive. it's been two days and I must say that I prefer wearing the clone (which is also quite present too). Scent: 8.2/10 Performance: 0/10 (it does not perform in my opinion as it does not fulfil the role I expect from a fragrance. For those who like perfumes that stay on them up until they actively shower it off, this is a 1000/10) Price: 8/10 (a bottle would last for an awfully long time given how strong and persistent it is.) For anyone that has the same issue with this fragrance as me, I found that spraying just on a piece of clothing or tying your hair in a bun then spraying over it once before untying it is the best way to get around the issue. You could also try the I Am White clone I received. It's not exactly the same but it's softer and more wearable.",
    "Smells bright and fruity. Feels luxurious and uplifting — like sunshine and sweet treats bundled into one.",
    "Synthetic mess of a horrible aroma chemicals.. this is the kind of fragrance you'd expect from a cheap middle Eastern dupe not a niche fragrance ..but alas.. You can't always tell the quality of a fragrance based on the price point which is why I don't fall into the 'expensive is better' trap.. I couldn't even get past the synthetic chemicals in this fragrance to even appreciate any of the fruits because all I could smell is gasoline and sharp Ambery notes and it was an assault to my senses..",
    "Just came back from Puerto Rico and so many of the uber drivers smelt like this or a at least a clone of it 😆😆😆",
    "It’s fresh and sweet fruits with vanilla amber and musk but not complex Easy to wear maybe too sweet for some, I liked it at first sniff, read many mixed reviews about this one and for me it turned out to be on the positive side Not something I would wear but would love to smell on anyone , unisex slightly leaning fem 8/10",
    "When I used it first time, it was puzzling, I didn't understand what it is. The second time I understood better: fruity musky scent, that's all I smell. I only had a sample but if this happens to be expensive then... I would pay maybe 60€ at most. Because it doesn't smell cheap but it's nothing too special either. It smells just nice and it's probably the first scent I like which has a fruity note in it although I haven't tried any other such. I also think the name and bottle colour is misleading because Erba makes one thing about herbs but it is far from herbs (green notes).",
    "this brand's hype is build on their luxuries \"high prices scheme\", majority of their perfumes is YUCK-smelling, including this one. I will never understand people who pays like 200$ retail to smell like horseshit sprinkled with rotten fruits. 2/10",
    "This is good, just don’t overspray it and wear it in the appropriate climate. She’s real strong!!! She’ll singe your nose hairs if you aren’t careful. If you don’t follow this advice, you and everyone around you, will be in an olfactory induced nightmare of your own making. One to three sprays is all you need and you’ll smell amazing! Pro tip: don’t spray around your face!! I spray the back of my neck, my chest and that’s it. I get compliments left and right. Honestly, some of these reviews are so overly dramatic.",
    "I had to get on here and write a review because this is quite literally the worst cologne I have ever smelled in my entire life. I’ve never had such a physical reaction to a scent before—this one manages to instantly induce a headache and makes me nauseous like nothing else. Maybe I’m allergic to something in there. I don’t know. But it makes me so, so sick. Don’t be fooled by the lovely refreshing notes it claims; this smells (AND FEELS) like sticking your nose into a bottle of rubbing alcohol, combined with burning rubber and some nauseating amber. Imagine snorting gasoline, because that’s how Erba Pura is in a nutshell. It burns the whole way up. I’m genuinely baffled by the positive reviews and “fruity” claims.. like I can’t stress enough how horrifying and downright evil this scent is. I work at a restaurant, which is where I had the pleasure of coming across this monstrosity—some guy came in 2 nights in a row wearing it and it permeated throughout the entire place within 20 minutes. I could not escape. The first night, I had 2 separate couples ask to be moved shortly after being seated next to him. I can’t prove that it was because of the stench, but I have a strong suspicion. Please spare yourself and everyone within a 20 ft radius and do not purchase this disaster of a cologne. I had to leave a bit early both nights because it made me so ill that I actually couldn’t function properly.",
    "It smells like Ushuaia grenade spray",
    "I don’t understand the hype. I think this brand has good marketing. All the perfumes that I try in this brand is a NO!",
    "if i hated someone i would spray this into their room",
    "are you guys for real... so everyone and their mom was hyping this up so much... all i hear is long lasting and. BEASTMODE... yada yada yada. so i came in with an open mind. i have other xerjoffs and i like them. my 1st mistake... second...blind bought em. thankfully a small bottle. everyone is saying its good for the summer. so i bought it for 2 summers ago... got it... i tried to like it. i dont want to believe that yall actually like this for summmerrrr... cuz this is headache. like... why?. i mean its long lasting. it clings on everything. pretty much overpowers everything. its not a bad fragrance if they take the vanilla down a notch it'll be a thing... or just use it in i dunno fall maybe.",
    "This is a beautifully fruity scent, which performs really well. I sprayed once on my arm and it went on for hours. It’s well-rounded, fruity, citrusy and musky. Close to other fragrances but somehow very different. I don’t know how they managed to get fruits to perform this well, but it’s the longest lasting bright fruit scent I’ve experienced. I know that there will be many soaps and body sprays which smell like delicious tropical fruit baskets but not all of them are done like this, and not all of them live for hours. Immediately added to my Wanted list.",
    "when i first got this out of the bottle i was not a huge fan i liked it but didnt think i got the money i paid worth out of it but, on skin this fragrance is amazing its sweet and fruity and it just smells more expensive i wouldn't reccomend this as a signature scent but its def a key piece in a rotation this fragrance is so tropical if you ever were to go on a cruise i can't think of a fragrance i would recommend more at the moment and i think the \"zesty\" narrative is kind of off, i can see why people say it because when you say sweet and fruity it does sound feminine but from actually putting my nose on it i believe they have blended it well into not leaning feminine and being just right in the middle unisex great projection and longevity also i am happy with this as a blind buy my only regret is not buying the 3.4",
    "ilk sıktığımda meyveli hafif narenciye acılı bir duş jeli kullanmışım gibi hissettiriyor. çok tatlı bir koku bence. yayılımı ve kalıcığı üst düzey. kuruduktan sonra veya kurumaya yakın vanilinmiş gibi kokuyor çok beğendim.",

    "Xerjoff is usually more miss than hit for me, but this one genuinely caught me off guard; in a good way ! That said, while I don’t think fragrance is inherently gendered, this fragrance would fit a man soooo well. It’s very aquatic; like the juicy, drippy kind, not the crisp, breezy kind, if that makes sense. Ridiculously fruity, borderline headache-inducing. Musky and just the right amount of racy. Honestly, this smells kind of promiscuous; in the best, most confident way possible. I wear it proudly, and yes, I absolutely stink up the room.",
    "If you want to give headaches to someone or choke out a room this would be something I’d reach for 0/10. It’s funny to me how this is their flagship hahah",
    "Famous for a reason, the hype is real. I don't even want to entertain the dupes. This is the first niche fragrance I actually want to save up my money for, God help me and my wallet. Remember that one tiktok of that arabic brand perfume oil that went viral, and the lady said it smells like an exotic woman w her boobs out getting fanned by palm leaves and fed grapes? Yeah... this is that. Not the oil. This is a hypnotic juicy tropical fruit basket in the heat of summer.",
    "So lets break this thing down shall we..... First, I think I should note that Erba Pura smells different from when you first open & spray your brand new bottle, to when it does 10 days later. That said, this fragrance needs a bit of air in order separate its notes. So dont judge it as soon as you take it out the package. Before the fragrance is allowed to open up I can see people having an issue with this \"Fruits\" note because its indistinguishably Fruity, yet sweet, & indistinguishably Fruity in the same way that Juicy Fruit Gum is. Juicy Fruit Gum doesnt actually contain any fruit juices. Its just a mix of chemicals that trick the mind into believing theres fruit juices within its Sweetness. So I totally get it when reviewers say it smells \"Synthetic\". Your brand new Erba Pura will indeed smell like a sweet synthetic mess. But thats because its extremely concentrated. But after you give it a few days to open up this is what you'll get. Upon its initial spray you'll be hit with a very authentic, loud, & sharp amalgamation of citrus notes. Specifically, Sicilian Orange, Calabrian bergamot & Sicilian Lemon. Whats adding to that nose piercing sharpness reviewers speak about is a note of Iris. Now, this Iris note wont be clearly distinguishable as Iris until the dry down due to the loud Syrupy Sweetness of the \"Fruits\" note. Now, when talking about the \"Fruits\" note, everyone picks up on something different. But to my nose this \"Fruits\" note smells like Mango's, Peaches, Pear, Passion Fruit, Pineapple, Honeydew Melon, Watermelon, Grapes, & Kiwi, all ripe, & all resting on a platter in their extremely sweet juices. I can also smell Melon Rinds. It smells Tropical. Yet somehow, It wouldnt feel out of place it was worn in Fall or Winter. As the fragrance transitions I can begin to pick up on faint Spices. To be exact, they're the same Spices as in Erba Gold. But again, they're faint. I also smell Amber, & while the Amber smells ambry, it also gives off a subtle Caramel nuance. Similar to the Caramel nuance in Erba Magica. I also pick up on Saffron & subtle Leather nuances, along with a subtle Cypriol note & its Crude Oil nuances. Theres also times where I get a quick waft of that Skank from Erba Oud. But again, these phantom notes will be missed if you've never smelled the Erba Flankers. Its in this moment within the fragrance were it smells very Middle Eastern. Its like you get Erba Magica, Erba Gold, Erba Leather, & Erba Oud all at once... & then its gone. As the fragrance continues on it loses its Middle Eastern influence, & I begin to pick up on Vanilla, Iris, Musk, & what smells like canned Peaches in their syrup, with soft nuances of Melon. .... and for me this is the longest part of the fragrance, & the best part. When the fragrance finally dries down hours later you're left with notes of Iris, & White Musk, & it smells exactly like the Iris/Musk combo in \"Skin on Skin\" by L'Artisan Parfumeur. Which I also own a bottle of. Erba Pura is Unisex, & its sweet. However, its no more sweet than Nishane's ANI, or Jean Paul Gaultier's UltraMale. Erba Pura can be worn year round. But I'd suggest that if its worn in Summer, its worn on cooler nights. The fragrance honestly smells better in the cool night air. With regards to performance, Erba Pura is a Nuclear Bomb, & it gets stronger as it wears on. So please, for the sake of your own nose dont over spray. Now, for the question that everyone's asking. Does Erba Pura get compliments ??? Erba Pura gets a shit ton of compliments. But personally, to my nose, Erba Pura is not what I would consider a \"Compliment Monster\". But to the average nose, for some reason, this fragrance just seems to drive em wild. You can wear this fragrance on Dates, to the Club, or to any outdoors event.",
    "Terrible, overly sweet, cloying, sickening and headache inducing arabic style scent.",
    "i think this fragrance is branded as a unisex but this is literally a womens perfume i think it smells nice but if i sniff from the actual sprayer its very strong and in your face longejevity is veryy long on this one, yesterday at 5pm i sprayed it once, i went to sleep and had a shower and i can still smell it. so yeah i think my downside is that its too feminine for me and can be quite obnoxiously strong, sometimes lingers like a bad fart 🥱",
    "This would be nice on a man wearing a collared button down and belted slacks for dinner on the coast. But I just can't see wearing it myself. It's nice but there are much more impressive scents in this category and price range.",
    "Best xerjoff. But for the price ther is other better options. A dupe from lattafa ana al abyad wich is ultra cheap. A dube from al haramin. Al haramain amber oud gold wich is the best dube of erba pura with great price.",
    "Best fragrance ever created. Erba Pura smells amazing from the first spray. It starts off fresh and fruity slightly powdery from the musk like going to a fruit market. It's the cleanest smoothest fragrance I've ever smelt and incredibly comforting, perfect for a summers night but you could wear it for any season. To my nose its only slightly citrusy from the fruits and I cannot smell a lot of amber. Performance and projection is fantastic I reccomend 8 to be smelt all day and from a distance. It is slightly on the synthetic side but in a good way. Mass appealing fragrance that is unisex but leans masculine in my opinion and is best fit for teenagers and young men. Good for all ocassions I don't know any dupes that smell like it but if you can afford it get it because it is the best fragrance ever perfumed.",
    "Too synthetic, feels like a bath and body work spray but beast mode",
    "Jesus Christ. Fruit everywhere. Fruit in my face, fruit down the hallway, fruit down the road, what the actual heck. This one's a bit much for me. I don't HATE it but I would never wear something like this. Synthetic smelling jam and musk. Way too daring. Trust me, if you want to make a statement, spray this one, people down the block will be aware!",
    "As much as I love this perfume, I have to admit that the amber in this bottle amped up the already sweet citrusy fruits. If it’s a food, it would absolutely cause diabetes. The vanilla didn’t help either, as it presented a creaminess that added to the already cloying nature of this perfume. I can say that it’s the musk that has been holding this all together, but it still gets overpowered most times. It fits a certain mood or vibe to be able to enjoy it, and that is why I have to unfortunately give it up. I had to find perfumes with similar scent profiles because I definitely love this DNA. In my research, I found that Kirke and Amber Oud Gold are the most similar but with a catch - Kirke, with the addition of heliotrope, patchouli and sandalwood, created a disharmony that caused it to smell synthetic in the dry-down, as opposed to AOG where something in the opening smelled screechy and synthetic but will later evolve to a 1:1 copy of Erba Pura. Maturation helps with the latter’s case, but there’s no saving the former. I also found Jardin Eclusif but something in that perfume screams metallic or rusty which is offensive(you can try for yourself and see if you’ll like it). BUT as with all the perfumes mentioned, PLEASE DO NOT OVERSPRAY! For goodness’ sake, be mindful of others. These are all nuclear perfumes and could cause olfactory warfare. If you don’t want people to hate you, then do not attempt to spray more than 5 spritz. ALSO, I smelled it on someone who I’m sure that didn’t take any shower at all, and it smelled almost rotten. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE! Make sure to spray it on ONLY after taking a bath because this does not mix well with some people’s natural musk or sweat. I beg of you! Anyway, if you want something more wearable, I suggest(AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND!) Erba Gold. It’s pricey but it’s worth it! Or if on a budget, try Amber Oud Gold, but you have to let it mature for about a month to diminish the synthetic note in the opening. Otherwise, scent profile, sillage and performance is almost 1:1 with Erba Pura.",
    "Femboy Cologne. That's the joke, thank you very much",
    "To me it's an array of different citrus fruits. All the goodness of all the citrus fruits: Their juice, their peel, their leaves, their seeds. I love it for that. It was the first time I smelled it today and I was expecting a total disaster of a scent, looking at the many negative reviews here. I was waiting for the most generic fruity citrus the perfume the world has ever created, but that was not the case. It was a lovely green and slightly herbal citrus perfume in the best possible way. I very much like it. And I love that it has a strong staying power, too...especially for a citrussy perfume. Thumbs up from me.",
    "A monstrously strong synthetic fruit bomb with some soft musks and vanillery amber underneath, overall I wouldn't say it's a bad scent, but it's definitely not my style, even if it does smell nice in the air. On my skin it's a moderately cloying fruit fragrance (not really tropical, just a wide variety of sweet fruit in general) that is both too strong and too aggressive on the sweetness for me to enjoy personally, if the fruit smelt more natural in this I think it'd be more palatable but the projection would undoubtedly plummet a lot I'd imagine, as a result, the fruits I this are so synethic on my skin they walk the fine like between tolerable and headache inducing, I like it when I get a few wiffs, but at other times it does start to hurt my head a little if that makes sense lol. Not only that, but this fragrance also smells juvenile to me, it's definitely unisex and a good warm weather scent regardless, but this very much feels like a later teenager/early 20s persons fragrance for sure, even moreso for the fragrance layman/everyday person, speaking of, this fragrance is quite common to come across in my country (Australia) with Broccoli heads and/or Eshay's, which is definitely not something I like being associated with, which has partially ruined its wearability a bit for me personally😂. My experience with the scent profile aside, it projects strongly and almost too strongly imo, especially for a fruity fresh fragrance, I got around 11-12 hours longevity on my skin, as I said irs perfectly unisex, and its also good for warmer and more moderate weather and occasions. In conclusion, if you honestly want a mass appealing fragrance from Xerjoff, I wholeheartedly recommend Naxos in every single way over this, I personally feel like it doubles as both a versatile and likeable mass appealing fragrance, and as a work of art in Perfumery whilst staying unique. Final Verdict is a 5/10 for me, if it was the only mass appealing fragrance from Xerjoff that was easy to like, it may have been higher, but since Naxos exists i just cant objectively rate it any higher.",
    "A fruity, sweet, ocean scent. Gives a good 3 hours of projection but after that it just lasts until u take a shower.",
    "The notes listed for this one indicate that I should like it. A lot. But OMG, what is that awful first note that won't leave my nose? Is it the intensity of the amber? It's in several perfume samples I've tried recently and it's so hard to get away from. I don't get fruit, candy, or any of the sweet things anyone here is saying they smell. It's just awful to my nose. I'm disappointed!",
    "Just coming back to remind y’all that this is a clone of Britney Spears Fantasy. Try to do a side by side test, go to the store and try the Britney, or just check out the other reviews here saying this. Btw Fantasy is like $20",
    "smells like juice with honey and mixed fruits",
    "WHOEVER CREATED ERBA PURA IS A GENIUS.Every time i smell this perfume in public it immediatly gives me a feeling of beauty,heaven,love.This never fails each time.So here i am at Istanbul's airport buying at last my own Erba Pura,feels so good to touch the sealed box of this heavenly juice i will be enjoying to wear for many many years ahead.To those who left negative reviews,thank you friends! For they flag key ponts i especially pay attention to when search perfume.YOU CANT WASH IT OFF, ITS NUCLEAR, LASTS EONS,MONSTROUS etc.All these characteristics i expect to be in my perfume.This beauty indeed has a character,so do i,feels so good to be together",
    "Public service announcement: Just because someone comments on your fragrance dosent mean you recieved a compliment. Let that sink in.",
    "Used to be so glazed but thanks to tik tok kids it’s hated and so forcefully, wonderful beautiful fresh fruit fragrance that’s unique compared to other freshies. 100 percent unisex, wonderful fragrance and one of the easiest niche fragrances to wear and one of the most sold/known and for a reason. 10/10",
    "Does not compute! Smells like rotten fruit to me. Not my jam. Hard pass.",
    "fruity and fresh absolutely nuclear it pulls compliments however synthetic this is unisex",
    "It smells like the best women's shampoo ever - but in a way that it's suitable for men to wear",
    "It's a beast. It also smells beastly. My nose is being hit with a mess of unpleasant synthetic notes. Screechy musk, rotten fruit and and a tar like note. This fragrance lasts forever and ever and its strength is headache inducing. Power! Try before you buy. I agree with a previous poster, because this fragrance is a popular clone, I can smell it everywhere in Germany, especially on track suit wearing teenagers. Maybe this is the perfume world's cilantro and it smells amazing to some folks. I'm baffled by the popularity of this concoction.",
    "Wow. Where do I start. Firstly I’d like to point out that this fragrance is a CRIME to the fragrance industry, a screechy, dirty, disgusting concoction that is spreading everywhere like pancreatic cancer, I genuinely cannot smell a hint of “perfume” in here, it’s full on inhaling sharp razors in and having it choke you to near death. It’s loved by broccoli heads and individuals with a below average mental capabilities. In no way can I imagine someone who knows jackshit about perfume to even remotely like this, especially in Germany, every other “gangster” rocks this or/and Kirke and Arabians Tonka, the pinnacle of chemical synthetic trash. Pretty sure this is what they pump into you when you’re getting cancer treated. If you wear this, please just know everyone around you absolutely despises you and thinks you’re a burden to society, you don’t smell good, you actually smell like bleach with a hint of shampoo, with all due disrespect.",
    "A sweet, powerful, charming, edible and sexy fruity fragrance that makes me feel pretty and sexy I bought it two years ago in Paris, and only now I truly appreciate its brilliance. It’s a compliment magnet and a true masterpiece of perfumery. So many dupes out there, but nothing truly compares! 10/10",
    "This is a high heat performer. The best tropical shampoo smell, clean and fresh. It just has to warm up majorly not to smell like 🤢. Yes, some people are blessed with a skin chemistry that works this way by default, but most- are not. If you live in tropical climate, and put it only on clean skin, most likely it’s a winner.",
    "I don't know about the others taste, but this is a great perfume for me. Maybe I'm crazy, but I don't think this is a very feminine perfume. Because the musk isn't that dominant, the vanilla balances things out a lot, and the opening reminds me a lot of Layton, maybe my nose projects different notes, but this perfume also has little \"testosterone\" in it, metaphorically speaking. The perfume is dominant, strong, loud, seductive, precisely because of that citrus note, it should not be applied too much, because it will really give you headaches, same thing like Sauvage Elixir. All those who hate this perfume are those with sensitive noses. We buy perfume for ourselves, not for others, because it's hard to convince 8 billion noses to like your perfume aka taste. A perfume does not deserve hate, and is it a masterpiece? It is not! It is the best Xerjoff? It is not, but it is good - it is.",

    "Head and Shoulders but make it fancy",
    "This makes me VERY nauseous.",
    "Xerjoff Erba Pura is definitely one of those fragrances that people either love or hate, and I have no problem saying I love it. It’s a powerful fruit basket scent with vanilla and a heavy musk, tropical and fun. Everyone around me always reacts positively when I wear it. For me, Erba Pura is an easy-to-wear, easy-to-enjoy fragrance—especially when there’s no one complaining about it being a synthetic mess!",
    "Best summer performance perfume, من احلى العطور الصيفية",
    "Smells like cheap shower gel I don’t understand how it got hyped up so much as it did. One of Xerjoffs worst creations",
    "editing my whole review... i've had this for a week and loved it but now i'm over it... i don't know how to explain this but it smells exactly like the fruit of the loom logo...except along with the synthetic fruit you can also smell the smell of the earthy wood they used to make the cornucopia along with the dirt and grass that came with it. gonna have to PASS. silly me bought TWO 3.4 oz because i thought i loved it...this was also stuck in my wig cap for 2+ washes...i could only dream every perfume was this strong. free me from the shackles of erba pura.",
    "OMFG what is this TERRIBLE scent?!? Sure I can smell the fruits in here but they Buried under what I think is some petrolatum or terpene derivative that reeks of something between gasoline and kerosene. I even put some on a paper sampler and a DAY later it was still there and just as bad. Who would want to wear this?!?! WHO WOULD WANT TO SMELL THIS BAD?!?! This is some crackhead crap. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!",
    "I haven't smelled this fragrance in a long time, but from what I can remember it was absolutely awful. I remember seeing it being hyped up on my tiktok feed, and I was so disappointed. Can't exactly describe the smell, but it was something weird with notes of cheap.",
    "Im not a fruity girl…..but baby! I love this! I can smell the fruits perfectly. It almost smells like candy. But yet still a mature 35 yr old woman age appropriate. Wear this if youre in a hot, tropical environment or a warm, summer night. Its lovely.",
    "The reason behind my dislike towards to this is not the fruitiness nor sweetness nor being synthetic. I do not enjoy the fruits, but for those who enjoy this can serve perfectly unisex. My problem with this, Erba Gold and Accento is how they all dry down to that spicy arabian-influenced musks. I hate that musk note and on my skin, throughout it's life of 12 hours, this stays on that part for 9. Not pleasent to my nose.",
    "Juicyfruit chewing gum:-) …..it’s beautiful.,,some might think it’s childish or too girly for a man….but it’s pretty unisex as far as tropical/fruity scents go.",
    "If I smelled this for the first time without any background information, I would think this is an extremely niche concept-perfume that was made with ironic intent to mock extreme tackiness. I imagine a visibly malnourished meth addict, fried platina blonde, botched lip fillers, full-time tiktok livestreamer that wears giant sunglasses with rhinestones and giant fake LV bags to wear this.",
    "Very good every day smell. Smells clean but not like detergent.",
    "Tried in store a while ago and enjoyed it. Decided to buy it from AuraFragrance cuz it was $130. Now I'm a little bummed. On my skin this is nothing more than a masculine musky mess. There's no fruit, no citrus, not even vanilla. I sprayed it on a card to make sure I wasn't going crazy, it smells normal on the card, it's just my skin chemisty making this smell completely different.",
    "Powerhouse of a fragrance. I love it, so fresh and summery! I am female and wear and love this, but it is so easily unisex. I also have God of Fire and I see a lot of similarities. I think someone wouldn't need both God of Fire and Erba Pura, they are too similar. Both are gorgeous, fruity, juicy and tropical.",
    "The same people bitchin' about the intense performance of frags like this, Oud Maracuja and Sauvage Elixir, also bitch when fragrances get watered down, reformulated and neutered. Have you geniuses tried spraying less (value for money, which used to be important in this community)?",
    "The new shiny bottles are at least half of power tuned down . Doesn’t justify the price anymore . Hence so many complained it’s too strong -> Be happy now and go buy it !!!! It’s less than moderate on my skin and not worth it anymore ! It’s a tragedy 😞. I really loved it when it was something ……",
    "It is more feminine 100%, the scent itself is amazing. If you want to buy it for your partner, safe blind buy guaranteed. 9/10",
    "Smells like a blonde femboy on a tropical resort with a trust fund. Smells like royal apple juice. Watery, Amber, fruity, sweet, synthetic. Id say this is a 10/10 women's scent thats worth every penny. Smells great with STRONG performance. Lasts all day and fills a room. So strong you can easily get sick of it. Get a sample first and wear it for a week to see if you get tired of it. EP is synthetic, so you can find good dupes in 2025. But none of them will match the original’s performance. Id say buy a dupe if the original is too strong.",
    "Fun in a bottle... Blast of Sweet up till lunch... This really packs a sweet punch... After lunch and stretching long into the evening it gets really interesting as Vanilla and then later Amber is added to the sweet underlay... Very good quality but you need a sweet tooth... Still a pleasant change from time to time... No doubting the quality... I really quite enjoyed the later evening element... Good Stuff... Surprised this doesn't have a higher rating, its not like you don't know what your getting into... Very good at what it claims to be... A real journey through the day... But overall I'd say this is a young guys scent... Feels a little desperate to be wearing this at my age... A pass from me... Erba Gold more suited to the older guy but as the sweet is toned down a little and replaced by more fruity citrus...",
    "I can see the appeal to certain noses but anyone that has any decent tastes at all will look right past this fragrance. The overall scent is reminiscent of a hair spray marketed towards teenage girls followed by spraying like three different girls body sprays of assorted fruits. I’ve smelt many girls rack store fragrances from no name brands that smell very similar to this and they cost between $10-$30.",
    "It is a tacky combination of fruits and musk, and smells cheap. There is nothing sophisticated and elegant in this perfume; it is just bling-bling showing off. It is a very offensive perfume for an offending price point. I am willing to pay a high price for perfumes, because I love perfumes, but this one doesn't deserve a fraction of that price.",
    "I have the feeling that Xerjoff toned down the chemical fruity notes and they amped up the musk in the newer batches (maybe even a reformulation?). However, my recently bought bottle seems to lack the original longevity. I get max. 6 hours out of mine (might be the olfactory fatigue though). Does anybody else have longevity and sillage issues with the newer batches (Nr. 24024N)?",
    "Not a safe BLIND BUY! It sounded so good and juice and wonderful…..🤢🤢🤢 oh Lord have mercy! It about knocked me on the ground with sharp musk! It lasted for days even after scrubbing. Why did I blinds buy this! Yikes. I don’t want anyone I’m around to smell like this! Headache inducing… it really is the Devils juice!",
    "smells like fabric softener, very strong smell gives me a headache. not recommended blindbuy",
    "i used to love you but now i hate you. Shit lowk fake asf i used to like it alot, but now i grew some hair on my balls and realised it just smells like a mad scientist trying to use chemicals to replicate a fruit of basket. Longevity last about 5 washing machines and projects thru the room.",
    "air freshener! yawnnnn",
    "Really wanted to like this but smelled up like straight shampoo to me and was too sharp for my nose. Not a realistic fruity scent to me",
    "nothing special and ridiculous pricing lasted one week on my skin tho,despite showering ;0",
    "The worst fragrance ever, please don't wear it near people 🤢",
    "very long lasting with beast projection but it smells very cheap extremely synthetic and harsh , instead this i would prefer twin perfumes by arabian oud.",
    "No. Just no. This is one of the first Xerjoff scents that both my husband and I dislike. If you're on a long road trip, and stop a random truck stop, and you go into the bathroom, they just put a brand new, just-unwrapped urinal cake in the urinal, and and you spill your peach slushy. That is the scent of Xerjoff Erba Pura. I know this is very popular, but neither of us can understand why.",
    "Horrible ... Tout ce battage médiatique pour ça... ? C'est un parfum chimique à mort , absolument rien de naturel, ca sens le désodorisant pour toilette bon marché et encore je suis gentil. Je suis choqué que la maison Xerjoff ai commercialisé un parfum de cette qualité et encore plus choqué que ca soit un succès commercial ! L'odeur est écoeurante et repoussante , il pourrait etre vendu chez lidl à 3€ je ne l'acheterai pas.",
    "EW. I smelled it at the airport and expected at least something because people are buying it a lot but this smells disgusting. It reeks of dirt, spice and an overperfumed man. Actually nasty",
    "Beast mode one spray l put on my hand at 6pm now at 4 am still going hard one spray 😩😁🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 l got old velvet suede bottle purchased yesterday",
    "@Farrque I second that. This is the most offensive perfume of all time. Even calling it a perfume is a reach, this is an odor - of rust, decay and dirt, with a hint of hand sanitizer on top. I don't know why I keep approaching these ambrocenide tributes in vibrant-colored bottles, maybe 'cause the top negative reviews are a bit hard to believe until you've tried it out for yourself, or because a negative experience is still an experience, but unless you too want to risk sending yourself into a scent-induced panic attack in case you're not noseblind to this amber mess - believe every one of them. This, THIS is what needs to be banned, IFRA: ambrocenide, the odor of hell.",
    "I will always believe xerjoff manufacture the best scents in the world. The world, erba pura is obviously the most popular scent they have and for good reason. Its in my top 5 Xerjoffs but i dont think its the best. Thats just how good some of the others are. Cruz Del Sur II is next level and Torino 22 is so solid but this does the job excellently, i have 3 sprays on right now 2 each side of neck and 1 on the back and its so strong. I applied 3 hours ago, absolute niche quality",
    "Citruses, vanilla ice cream, mango sorbet, white musk and xerjoff’s obnoxiously loud amber accord. I hate Xerjoff deeply for giving scents like this a platform.",
    "Same issue with the reviewer before me, it lasts nothing on my skin. I even tried using vaseline(to enhance the duration) at got 0 projection. However it dries into a delicious skin scent.",
    "I'm so bummed about the performance of this fragrance. The scent itself is absolutely gorgeous, I really love it. It just disappears so quickly, though! For the price, I expected way better longevity. Anyone else have this issue? It lasts maybe a few hours on my skin and the projection is abysmal. More of a close skin scent. I've checked the batch code and it's 5 years old. Surely it shouldn't be this abysmal. One of the reasons I got this perfume was because everyone was going on about the \"beastly\" performance. The only thing beastly about this fragrance is the price. The bottle is gorgeous and so is the box, but that doesn't make up for the fact it's as weak as puddle water. Xerjoff Urba Pura Perfume Review Xerjoff Urba Pura is an exquisite fragrance that brings the perfect balance of sophistication and modernity. From the first spray, Urba Pura exudes an elegant blend of citrusy brightness and rich, warm undertones, making it a versatile scent that works for any occasion, whether day or night. The opening notes are a refreshing burst of bergamot, mandarin, and lemon, offering a lively and uplifting citrus experience. These are followed by a delicate floral heart with hints of jasmine and rose, which add a touch of softness without overwhelming the composition. The base is where Urba Pura truly shines, as it settles into a luxurious mix of creamy woods, amber, and musk, creating a velvety warmth that lingers on the skin. What sets Urba Pura apart is its complexity and the way the different layers evolve over time. The citrus notes don't fade too quickly, providing a crisp and energetic top that effortlessly transitions into the deeper, more sensual base. The packaging of Xerjoff Urba Pura is just as refined as the scent inside—a sleek, elegant bottle that exudes luxury. It’s a fragrance that feels both timeless and contemporary, making it perfect for those who want something unique, yet wearable. In conclusion, Xerjoff Urba Pura is a stunning fragrance that offers an ideal balance of freshness and warmth. It’s a great choice for individuals who appreciate high-quality ingredients and well-crafted compositions, and it’s sure to turn heads wherever you go. Shame about the performance. Everything else is wonderful about this scent",
    "I love it but i feel is more female fragance",
    "(Sample from Surrender to Chance) This is a really fun girl. She’s super cute, she uses We Heart It. She’s a bit of a Korea-boo and she loves TWICE. If she were to bring anything to the picnic it’d be a fruit platter because she’s on and off a diet. She’s a sucker for a mimosa and getting her home is hell. 9/10",
    "The strong fruity notes in the base notes are nice but I didn't like the creamy feeling. Is it bad? Not at all. In fact, it's much better than 75-80% of the perfumes on the market. But perfumes are a matter of personal taste. I understand why people like this perfume but personally I wouldn't buy it. 7/10",
    "Well - I expected more. Candy, synthetic smell, I love the citruses, but nothing spectacular. The bottle is amazing tho! Rate - 7/10. Vibes - beach, fresh, synthetically sweetq unisex.",
    "I just got it I think it’s a good scent if you are younger and you want to people to think your a little more feminine or you just like smelling like that when I first smelled it I thought of a grapefruit IPA for some reason very strong but I’m more of a wood oud more masculine smelling guy that’s what I want to smell like and I thought my mom could rock this good but in the middle of unisex and female",
    "I thought I was going to be the person that preferred Erba Gold. I was wrong. This is BEAST mode. Huge blast of fruits with some citrus notes. On the sweeter side but still nice. Great Summer frag. 8/10",
    "The opening is disappointing. The dry down is a bit creamier, which I almost think I like. Yeah, I’m just not digging this. 3/10",
    "Separate yourself from the wanna-be esoteric snobs on here and apply it on a friend. Smell the sweet, clean, tropical sillage emitting from them and be in awe.",
    "This is the absolute best fragrance I own. The projection is amazing, the vanilla works so well with the musk, and the fruit notes can actually project more than an inch from my body. I can't believe I'm alive at the same time Erba Pura exists. 100/10, every dollar well spent. tiger approved. give me mangos or give me death. >:3",
    "I really love this, it smells minty and fresh. I can smell the sweetness a little bit. I honestly don't get citrus at all. The blending is really nice. My husband reckons it smells like urinal cakes 😭",
    "A lovely fragrance, though a bit too fruity for my taste. The fruitiness feels somewhat artificial, and I wish it had a fresher element to balance it out. As it is, it leans a little too strong and could easily become overwhelming.",
    "smells like fruity soap not worth the price and hype",
    "Literally the worst cologne I’ve ever owned second to Al haramain amber oud.. the cologne literally assaulted my nose it kicked and punched my nose with an offensive scent. I couldn’t wait for this to get off my skin and for the cheap price of over $100 I’d say this is best for people who want to waste their money.",
    "fruits and amber id say, still get whiffs of a sharrp fruit accord. sharp ish like the arab scents do it. i think its that fruit and amber thing happenng, is it etallic? unsure. i might try a few dupes and see what i think",
    "im not hugely wsure i like this, i feel a sharpness to it which just rounds at its peak. to me this id is a green fruity with a sharp maybe vetif=ver-like base.. theres something vinegar like in the oouter notes it feels like - not stringly but a facit - leans also tart ambery maybe? bright and slightly dense, almost sharp, theres a shampooey roundedness in there.. perhaps a bit of the ie eraser scent too whatever makes that",
    "This smells like Armani's \"Stronger With You\" to me. I hated every minute of having this on my hand.",
    "Erba Pura, by Xerjoff, smells like Cappy Orange juice with orange pulp in it, fruity candies, powder and a hint of a stale aquatic note. In the opening, all you can smell is a Cappy Orange juice with orange pulp in it. I love this scent, but unfortunately, it evaporates after a few minutes. When it dries down a little bit, the fragrance leaves you with a scent of fruity jelly bean candies, a scent you can often find in a Xerjoff fragrance. In Erba Pura, this scent is accompanied by powdery musk and a stale aquatic note. I didn't hear anyone say they smell that aquatic note too, but to my nose, it is there. It's an aquatic note that I also smell in Megamare by Orto Parisi, I don't know how to describe it in a better way. Considering everything previously mentioned, Erba Pura is not a linear fragrance and you do smell a different perfume after some time, instead of the one you sprayed at the beginning. The perfume does have the general Xerjoff vibe: it smells refined and expensive, you smell classic Xerjoff notes in it and it is very elegant. The longevity and projection are very good. Would I wear it? I think that aquatic scent I am picking up doesn't fit me, but nevertheless, it is a great perfume.",
    "one of the strongest fragrances that you can easily wear during summer, however it is not only a summer scent. you can wear this throughout the whole year. lasts 4 5 days on clothes projects crazy for 5 6 hours and keeps projecting till 9 10 hours, you can smell musk-fruits little bit of orange at the opening however as it dries down the citrus notes disappear completely and vanilla-amber take over with a bit of fruit and hints of musk. might smell a bit synthetic, do not blind buy but does not deserve the hate. If you have enough money, buy Erba Gold, far better, projects good (not as good but still very good)",
    "Bathroom spray",
    "Just pure melon/cantaloupe in a bottle.",
    "I am so tired of much of the reviews on fragrantica. If you don’t like a fragrance, just say it didn’t work for you, list the reasons why and move on. There’s no need to insult our community’s sense of taste, or unleash a long winded diatribe, filled with unnecessary judgements about the type of people who happen to like something you don’t. Honestly, it’s just not fun and inclusive for anyone when we approach our reviews in that way. But ya know, whatever, do you boo. ✨🩵✨",
    "these nerds be doing too much on these reviews, aint no one give a f bout the fact that it’s synthetic only thing that matter is that it smells good ion care bout how many chemicals this shi has if it smells good im wearing it",
    "A lot of people are saying \"this works on my skin\" and \"this doesn't smell like wet dog on me\". That's great, but it won't stop others smelling wet dog on you! This fragrance is stuffed full of the most powerful molecules that exist in perfumery. Norlimbanol, Amber Xtreme, Amber Core, Grisalva, Cedramber, etc. These synthetic molecules smell great to 80-90% of people. But they're infamous for not smelling the same to everyone. Some people are more sensitive to them than others, and some detect dirty animalic faucets in them. The wearer's skin has nothing to do with this. Only each person's nose. That's why this fragrance is divisive. If you smell what the perfumer intended for you to smell, it's amazing. But if your personal perception of these mega-beastmode molecules differs, this can be absolutely terrible. It's the wearer's responsibility to make a decision. Are you willing to force a scent onto everyone with massive projection, when there's a 10% chance any given person will think you smell like a stinking wet dog?",
    "The same people bitchin' about the intense performance of frags like this, Oud Maracuja and Sauvage Elixir, also bitch when fragrances get watered down, reformulated and neutered. Have you geniuses tried spraying less (value for money, which used to be important in this community)?",
    "I purchased a bottle of Erba Pura recently after going back and forth with testing it out. The only thing stopping me from purchasing it sooner was that the bottle is covered in velvet. I detest the feeling of velvet. I love how this fragrance incorporates Middle Eastern influence into mainstream perfumery. Across my friendship group, my friends from the Middle East smell the best. They have no qualms in wearing a strong scent day or night. And I love that about them. All that aside, Erba Pura is a beautiful scent. A fruit cocktail with citrus to prevent it from smelling like a juvenile, immature body spray. It smells expensive. It’s also a chameleon scent. If you wear it in the day it projects just enough so that those close to you can smell it. However, when the sun goes down this perfume comes to life. I’ve experienced this with brands such as Mancera and Montale. At night, this lingers in the air, will enter a room before you do and stay in that room upon your departure. Scent: 10/10 Lasting power 10/10 Sillage 10/10",
    "This is one of the most offensive scents that I ever smelled. I received a sample with a different order and I left it, unopened, on the dresser in the bedroom. My husband walked into the room and said \"what is this horrible smell? it smells like the locker of a gym\". It's musky, musty, it has the sweetness of a decomposing fruit, it's nauseating, it's STRONG. I see some define it as \"attention grabber\". oh, yes. Not showering for a month and using the same clothes over and over without washing them will do the same. I know that scents are a question of taste - I respect that - but I truly hope I'll never have to share a space with someone wearing Erba Pura.",
    "Sickening sharp fruity notes and sweet woody vanilla. Made to last. I couldn’t wash it off my wrist.. it stayed all day and night. Can be used as a weapon of mass repulsion. You've been warned.",
    "The description sounded lovely but god did it make me sick when it dries down! There’s a note I can’t yet identify that is at the heart of many perfumes that I can’t tolerate well - very powdery, yet acrid and chemical. I would love to find out what it is so I can avoid other perfumes that have it. I sprayed it once into the air and that base note is still sitting on my carpet 18 hours later. Yuck!",
    "Even though I’m by no means a connoisseur in fragrances, I consider myself quite liberal in taste. I can appreciate and wear anything from heady white florals, challenging animalics and deep dark ouds. But this is the fragrance from hell. Sharp, screechy, sour and rancid fruits that’s kills all your (and everyone elses) senses. Impossible to shower or scrub off, it will follow you until you want to throw up. I hate it with a passion. But also, isn’t this the beauty of fragrance, how it moves us all in different ways? 😌 For me it moves me away from this, as far as I can get. 😉",
    "This could just be a horrible match with my skin chemistry. But on ME, this scent is a giant dumpster fire. This is 1 of two fragrances I have tested in my entire life that offended my senses so severely it became “scrubber” status. To It smells like gelatinous, rotting citrus tossed out in a gas station parking lot, sun beating down on it during the hottest, humid day in history. I appreciate and enjoy a wide variety of scent profiles including the bold and abstract. But on me, EP is a sensory nightmare and only time experiencing a scent that actually makes my nose sting. I CANNOT get this chemical warfare off of me! Send help! Luckily it is only on one wrist, as i was testing a sample of it and sprayed 3 times. After multiple scrubs, a shower and 13 hours, it has not toned down one bit (and my skin devours fragrance, so I always struggle with longevity). SamplIng this became a date that turned into a stalker I cannot escape. Bottom line: “Its a no for me, dog”"
