  "description": "Black Sea by Lorenzo Pazzaglia is a fragrance for women and men. Black Sea was launched in 2019. The nose behind this fragrance is Lorenzo Pazzaglia. Top notes are Salt, Ozonic notes, Watery Notes, Myrtle and Bergamot; middle notes are Sea Notes, Salt, Ylang-Ylang and Orange Blossom; base notes are Ambergris, Algae, White Musk, Oakmoss and Patchouli. \"The sky darkens and the sea is calm, just before the storm. The wind arrives with its load of flowers and aromatic herbs and the menacing sky is reflected in the leaden water that looks like ink. It's a moment: the waves slap the rocks with such a force as to saturate the air and the saltiness applauds the air filling the lungs. Nature is demonstrating her immense strength. Black Sea is a perfume that releases the power of the elements, a fragrance for me as I fearlessly throw myself into the arms of a creation to be discovered. \" - Antea DevonTop Notes: Bergamot, Sardinian Myrtle, Salt, Ozone, Aquatic Notes Heart notes: Orange Blossom, Black Salt of Cyprus, Ylang-Ylang, Marine Notes Base Notes: Seaweed, White Musk, Patchouli, Oakmoss, OrientalgrisRead about this perfume in other languages: Deutsch, Español, Français, Čeština, Italiano, Русский, Polski, Português, Ελληνικά, 汉语, Nederlands, Srpski, Română, العربية, Українська, Монгол, עברית.",

  "review": [
    "I have had this on my wrist for around an hour so far and it it is a lovely fragrance , I was worried it wouldn't be wearable but it is nicely blended and addictive to smell… and this is where I say … It reminds me of PDM Layton in the dry down ?!?! WTH? This is saltier and many notes are different but i am guessing the bergamot vanilla blend is what makes it similar . Its certainly not a bad thing as both are amazing but it almost puts me off having both fragrances. I will have to see how long this lasts and compare them both together.",
    "Has potential; lacks performance. I enjoy Megamare and Atlas that have similar profile and much better performance. Shukran Habibi!",
    "This is a potent salty marine fragrance. Lasts like 10 hours on my skin, and forever on clothes. Smells a bit synthetic, but my wife loves it on me.",
    "Black sea it’s not a freshie everyday fragrance it feels like a night inside a rusty yacht in the middle of the ocean it’s a very salty fragrance it feels like a foggy weather inside the ocean while it’s raining and it’s a very dark and masculine fragrance not everyone can wear this one in my opinion if we compare it to megamare this one is by far better than megamare you can feel every note in this fragrance feels like a voyage under the ocean.",
    "A salty summer beast. Projects well and lasts long, especially on clothes—I was getting compliments on it hours after spraying. My friends said they thought I smelled like a salty thing emerging from the sea (in a good way) but to my nose this just smelled like a lighter, slightly fresher version of Megamare (my sworn nemesis in the world of marine fragrances). While it’s definitely better and more wearable than its successor Artik Sea, it was almost headache-inducing for me. Might just save this one for when I’m going out to the club and want to smell like a sexy, dirty sea sprite who hunts sailors for sport.",
    "Black Sea isn't your typical fresh aquatic scent. Instead, it feels like a night sea, where cold, salty minerals mix with warm, smoky resins. The scent creates a mysterious marine mood, blending fog, wet wood, and grey amber. You first notice a flash of citrus—bitter orange and bergamot—mixed with black pepper and a salty, briny note that hints at waves hitting your skin. Next, you get seaweed and marine herbs, a gentle herbal bitterness from myrtle and rosemary, and a hint of metallic ozone. Here, the fragrance declares its difference: the sea here feels alive and full of energy, not just clean and simple. Sperm whale amber, labdanum resin, and salt-etched woods (cedar/guaiac) with a warm leather trace and a light smoke-like scent, reminiscent of damp wood starting to ignite. It’s a mix of salt, smoke, and amber, moving from the chill of beach metals to a warm, mysterious feeling like late-night fires by the shore. Longevity: 8–10 hours on skin, and may extend longer on fabric. Sillage: moderate leaning towards strong in the first two hours, then settles into a near-medium aura. The fragrance line is present and clear in air-conditioned indoor spaces; outdoors, its trace remains attractively salty and woody. Excellent for summer and spring evenings, and mild autumn nights; in hot summer days, it can be intense if over-sprayed. Wearing this scent adds style to smart-casual or relaxed formal outfits, especially when paired with dark colours and crisp shirts. This is for anyone looking for a mature marine scent that's more dramatic and deep than typical fresh blue perfumes. It suits both men and women with a clear masculine leaning. If you enjoy Pazzaglia's darker scents or like the idea of an amber night sea, Black Sea is worth trying. And if you're looking for a straightforward, refreshing scent, this one might feel too deep in the \"aquatic\" category. A beautiful balance between salty minerals and warm resin; a distinctive character. Outstanding performance for such a style. Weaknesses: The opening's iodine/mineral aspect may seem \"brutal\" to those seeking a clean, easy-wearing marine scent. It requires measured doses in extreme heat. Based on my personal experience in Iraq's hot climate, the suggested spraying method would be three to four sprays (neck, behind the ears, chest/collar) in the evening. You might also try a light layer underneath the fragrance of \"dry citric cologne\" if you wish to soften the saltiness during the day. In the end, I say... Black Sea by Lorenzo Pazzaglia turns the sea from a calm postcard into a nighttime scene, with sharp salt, warm smoke, and driftwood. This is a moody fragrance with strong character and artistic style, perfect when you want a deeper, more serious take on the sea. Ahmed Hadi – Baghdad – IRAQ",
    "bro i put 7 sprays it's too strong both performance and longevity 10/10",
    "I sampled this recently, hoping I would love it. And while I did, not at all for myself. It smelled strongly masculine to me, and I am one who typically likes unisex, feminine leaning scents. I have other perfumes that many people say lean masculine but I think are quite feminine (e.g., Gris Charnel Extrait), but this one was very manly to me. I'd love to get it for my husband!",
    "Unfortunately I can’t help to feel as many may have obtained counterfeit bottles of this stuff. What I own stays in your clothes even after they have been washed . so I’m sorry yours is not lasting long. And I have been told I can be smelled 100 feet away. I can’t see how it does not perform for anyone. And if it’s too strong just use less and get more bang for your buck. What’s wrong with that ? Well I don’t know but to each their own. Yes it is a beast but just don’t wear it to work around the cry babies. Some people are sensitive to smelling good. Then there are cry babies. Pussies !! Heck I go out and women and even girls for that matter have stopped me to say I smell good. For anyone seeking a good or a true ole factory experience ,I would say definitely give this a try. It checks all the boxes. Especially in this heat. Peace and love and good happiness stuff to all ✌🏾",
    "One of the best marine fragrances I’ve smelled! This is a dark, masculine, peppery, and somewhat airy fragrance that smells amazing😍. It is very potent, but it doesn’t have huge sillage. It is spicy and salty, but does not fill the room with a strong type of scent like YSL or an Arabian dupe cologne. This is a 9/10",
    "Absolutely gorgeous with amazing longevity. More multi-faceted than Megamare (which I also love). Perfectly unisex, in my opinion.",
    "أستخدمه في الصيف بكثرة بدون أي تردد من أولويات اختياراتي في العطور المنعشة احيانا تكون رشة تعزيزيه بعد النهار ..",
    "It opens up with so much black pepper and salt. But within 10 minutes goes into Megamare territory, not a clone but 80-85% the same. It's more wearable than Megamare which i had a full bottle. I don'r know why but i think this would be so sexy on a girl, although it's quite dense and has no sweetness.",
    "This is the best blue marine perfume in the market (salty & mixed with seaweed). My wife's favorite blue fragrance. The only problem with this fragrance and it is a big one, is the performance. Black Sea is the definition of beast mode, which unfortunately makes it unwearable. One spray is more than enough, 2 sprays or more is guaranteed to either choke you out or someone else who gets within 5 feet from you. For all folks below who complained about the lack of performance, most likely you bought a fake perfume.",
    "mi favorita del 2025",
    "Pungente, verde cupo e bluastro,odori di piante balsamiche e ricordi di acqua,che sia mare o lago nel bosco. Aggiornamento: dopo 7 ore l'odore è sempre molto forte,si espande e riempie l'ambiente dove era la striscetta di carta su cui è stato spruzzato. Beh, direi che rientra nei sinteticoni esagerati che vanno di moda nella nicchia ora e non solo. Purtroppo non amo questo tipo di profumeria. Credo che nemmeno questo sarà per me.",
    "Very artistic house this, just got this one and tried cherry ink as well both very interesting",
    "Its like you get wet from the rain just you smell good 🤣",
    "Calone vibe turned to the max with salty / algae like undertones. I don’t get the hype with this brand. This smells good & probably makes much more sense 10 feet behind the wearer but… being the wearer… it’s just too much. It’s like taking a photo, editing it, turning the contrast to 100% & then trying to appreciate it’s composition.",
    "Ok, I love a good strong aqua scent lots of minerals, sea vibes. Tried a good few variants, the wife does not like the scent profile (esp.black caviar) but I love it the profile divorce imminent. Back on track, I love the scent it grows by the minute,. lovely rich aquatic with great projection",
    "A mi parecer es un perfume intimo pero muy atrevido, no es para cualquiera pues refleja una oscuridad apolvada muy unica en su tipo, diria que es un mar apolvado",
    "Sample arrived today. Sprayed on my hand, thought it was great, but wasn't 100% sure on how much I liked it. Just given it a full wear and honestly this is intoxicating and invigorating. The quality is good, but there are better quality offerings out there, BUT (again), few of them feel as exciting to wear as this. It's so uplifting and unique in the air. Perfect example, I was loving Profumum Roma's Orangea (on my wrist). I tried it several times on my wrist and the quality is off the charts. But, I gave it a full wear and it bored me. It didn't excite me in the slightest. I think I'll be getting a full bottle of Black Sea for summer. Fantastic fragrance. Oh, and I do not get the Acqua Di Sale comparisons at all! This is closer to Pernoire's Vitias IMO, but this is better. I've learnt that the wear experience is key before buying!",
    "Invigorating",
    "This is really bad perfumery. Absolutely atrocious",
    "After a fancy and complex opening this is basically Aqua Di Sale :) if you didn’t smell neither of them. I can explain this as lots of liquid salt and some ambergris. Other notes vanishes after 5 minutes. These are whats left.",
    "I haven’t smelled the reformulation of Tom Ford’s Oud Minėrale, but this fragrance is very reminiscent of the original aforementioned designer frag when it was part of the private blend collection. Black Sea, however, is much better quality. The seaweed note in Black Sea is not as potent and as off-putting as it is in TF OM. The ozonic notes help dampen And this thing is beast. I can’t wait for the warmer weather to show up and see how it performs in the higher humidity.",
    "Some of us use perfumes to ‘smell real good to other folks’. Others understand the true measure of fragrance. Perfumery is an art form and when it is used as such, can be transformative. Black Sea is a journey. Wearing it, being shrouded in its heart is to be transported to the furthest depths of a restless sea.",
    "Opening is very masculine and salty, very shower gel like. This scent is for sure not unisex, more suited for men. Dry down after 20 or so minutes becomes a lot more ocean-like, and the seaweed and marine notes are in full effect. Performance is great, and you will only need 2-3 sprays of this. Overall: 9/10 Aquatic, Dark, Masculine.",
    "I'm afraid I have to share some other peoples' concern about a reformulation below me: Purchased a sample from a decanter a couple years ago. The scent projected like there is no tomorrow and lasted on skin until scrubbed off. Decided last summer that Black Sea is full-bottle worthy, and ordered a brand new one from a reputable retailer. However, to my dismay, I found the performance atrocious compared to how I remembered my sample being. Granted, longevity was fine, but projection was non-existent. Consequently, sold the bottle. (And no, it wasn't nose blindness; my SO or family couldn't really pick up the scent either not long after heavy spraying.) A couple months later, I found a great deal on a second-hand bottle, and thought I could give it another try; if the performance was still lacklustre, I might as well use it as an office scent. But no. Oh, no, no. This juice was just like I recall my sample being, an absolute monster in every regard.",
    "Very good, enjoy it. Recommend.",
    "This is a beautiful scent, but it leans a bit too masc for me, I will buy it for my future husband. It is salty & fresh, kind of reminds me of fresh scent old spice shower gel.",
    "I blind bought this and was initially disappointed by the strong camphorous smell that was giving Vicks vapor rub. Let this rest in my closet for a few months and something smoother is beginning to emerge. I’ll leave an updated review but it’s improving. I used to only keep one bottle of fragrance at a time but now that I started collecting- it’s amazing to see how different perfumes smell over the year(s), time of day, season, and even my mood. This perfume is more of a curiosity for now but maybe I’ll find more to love about it in the future…",
    "Quite the aquatic, perhaps best suited for professional settings. It is extremely potent and lifeless at the same time. 4.5/10",
    "Love this. Performance is literally ridiculous. So far all the LP fragrances I’ve tested punch seriously hard.",
    "I no longer think this perfume is beast mode. I’ve always purchased it from a reliable seller who sells originals, but its longevity is truly disappointing. It’s a true dark aquatic fragrance, but with this level of performance, I can opt for better perfumes. It was a disappointment.",
    "Black Sea is one of the best marine fragrances I've worn recently with a beast-level stability (Longevity & Sillage) featuring a fresh and distinctive formula inspired by the Black Sea coasts. The fragrance combines refreshing salty watery notes with earthy woody notes, making it a unique fragrance. Black Sea is categorized as a unisex fragrance, which means it is suitable for both genders. However, some people may be tempted to consider it a more man-friendly fragrance because of its woody and earthy notes. The fragrance is suitable for everyday use, but it can be a bit heavy for hot weather or formal occasions. Black Sea is best suited in spring and autumn, when it's mild. It can also be used in the summer, but it is preferable to use it in small quantities. Black Sea is a medium-strength fragrance, neither too heavy nor too light. The fragrance is best suited in temperate climates, but can also be used in cold climates. Black Sea can be used day and night, but it is preferable to use it in the evening and special occasions. Black Sea is a distinctive and different fragrance, but it may not suit all tastes. I advise you to try it yourself before buying to make sure it suits your personal taste. Conclusion: Black Sea is an icon of the Italian perfume house Lorenzo Pazzaglia",
    "Megemare zamanında çok övülmüştü, öyle bir deniz parfümü ki sıradan bir deniz değil okyanusta dev dalgalar arasında puslu bir havada hırçın bir deniz.. Böyle betimlenince dayanamayıp dekantını aldık, pek deniz parfümü havası alamadım ve beğenemedim, çocukken bakkalların önünde satılan, güneşten rengi solmuş plastik topların ikiye bölündüğünde içinden çıkan kokuya daha çok benzettim, o övgüleri yağdıranlar hala aynı aşkla bağlı mı o parfüme merak ediyorum. Acqua Di Sale için deniz parfümü diyebilirim ama Kumburgaz denizi; Marmara kıyılarına lodosla vuran yosunların çürümeye başlamasıyla bastığınızda çamura saplanmış gibi olduğunuz o kıyıların kokusu.. Burun yakan keskin tuzlu hissiyata rağmen realistik bir çalışma olduğu için sevilebilir. Black sea de burun zorlayan yada fazla yapaylık hissettiren bir durum gözlemlemedim. Sucul bir parfümden beklenen şekilde ferah bir havası da var, öyle kasvetli bir parfüm değil, güzel.",
    "Sea water, sand, and clean powder; that’s what it evokes on my skin. It feels like swimming in the sea while it rains. The Black Sea is always restless; so is this scent. Perfect for anyone longing for salt. I love it deeply; it satisfies me on every level, both dark and bright. The inclusion of Black Salt of Cyprus makes me especially happy, being Cypriot myself. The grey ambergris is just right, and the mossy elements are never overdone. One of my favourite marines; if Villa Lympia is daylight, this is the night. Longevity is impressive; close to beast mode.Tag(s): sea, salt, dark, beast",
    "The sea imbued with wonderful essences: enigmatic, deep, dark, restless and rebellious towards the imminent storm. Crossed and moved by the wind with its redundant load of exotic flowers, fresh, lively, aromatic herbs, a Mediterranean hint of myrtle that hovers supreme and is dispersed in the tormented sky that breaks menacingly in the bluish and leaden water. The intrepid and swirling waves stand out violently on the shiny rocks, raising an impetuous, pungent, brackish and ozonic marine aquatic vapour. The storm raises persuasive notes of ambergris to the sky which characterize the entire olfactory experience. Black Sea is a powerful, exuberant fragrance, which embodies the kaleidoscopic olfactory magic of the sea.",
    "All I smell is disinfectant cleaner. Nothing deep and dark about this...",
    "Na ppczatku i jak sie malo psiknie to czuc taki okropnie mdly zapach. Ta nuta zapachowa pachnie identycznie jak woreczki zapachowe z kolorowa sola ktore mozna kupic w kopalni soli. Ale jak sie duzo popsika to czuc taka ostrą swiezosc. Zapach na bluzce przypominal lekko zapach nowych ubran z hm. Taki swidrujacy w nosie.",
    "citrus and herbs -- an old goatherd is gathering wild seasonings for his dinner-- the breeze is cool but the day is warm in the sun and the herbs release their vaporous delectable nature into the air, turning the entire hillside into an herbal rock spa. The rivers flow down to the sea year round here. A constant fresh repleneshment. The sea in turn nurtures life. Anise grows wild here, amid a rocky mineral note by the warm salt sea.",
    "I bought this from an authorized store during my trip to Spain. This perfume is no longer in beast mode as mentioned. I don't know if it was like that before! Buy it knowing this. I could barely smell the longevity on my clothes the next day when I smelled it very closely, the sillage was 3-4 hours from shoulder distance.",
    "Update : 😅🤣honestly its nice and fitting summer hot days 🙌🏻😶🌫️ Glycerin + baby wipes 👎🏻",
    "Dark blue salty abyssal fragrance. This is the summary of my experience with the fragrance. Supporting citrus tone to an oceanic scent. I pick up the plant-like green touch the myrtle brings to the fragrance but in a powdery way, especially through the first hour. The lack of citruses, if you so wished to find here can be found in Sex-Sea also by LP, they are similar in construction but sex-sea is much less mature. Performance is stellar! Nothing extreme/suffocating but I'm able to smell myself way past the 4th hour of wearing it. Will stay on skin for over 8h and will for sure allow for others to smell you with great sillage and projection. Now, I don't support blind buying this as, to some, it may be too salty. However, I get a well balanced experience with nothing being too over the top! Price point is okay I'd say, 50ml for ~150 is what I paid and will last a long time as probably 8 sprays is the most I can pull off with this when outside but typical 5-6 indoor will get you plenty of time on skin. Avoid clothes as the fragrance will stick after good 1-2 washes. This is a must sample, to say the least. In the Sea line, my order is Sex-Sea, Black Sea, Dream Sea, and Artik Sea from the ones I've tried.",
    "Sin conocerlo, ni haber escuchado nada de este perfume, la primera vez que lo olí fue amor a primera vista. Me parece un perfume masculino, diferente, modo bestia (la gente nota cuando llegas a un sitio), sensual y que me ha dado varios cumplidos. Adicionalmente, en mi piel dura 12 horas con tan solo 3 sprays, algo que no cualquier fragancia logra puesto que el ph de mi piel es acido. Es un perfume que no es para todo el mundo, pero en mi opinión es un 10 de 10.",
    "Like a tamer version of arktik sea Still very pleasant Kind of reminding me of a less potent acqua di sale",
    "I smell mainly aquatic notes and it's very strong and mass appealing to everyone around me, only certain people can make out the seaweed smelling note though, it's very subtle but there. But this is very very very very very very very synthetic scent, it's not bad but sometimes it can get me reconsidering if I want to buy this or not, it's smells a lot better on clothes for me.",
    "This is the mysterious and invigorating essence of the deep sea. The salty and fresh notes give it that oceanic feel, while the spicy elements add a bit of warmth and depth. The hint of mint, even if not listed, could be contributing a subtle coolness, enhancing the overall impression of a deep-sea voyage. This stuff is strong. 2 sprays will be a room-filler. Although I do appreciate this fragrance, it is not my cup of tea.",
    "Stormy dark aquatic from hell, it will never disappear while being overwhelming to everyone in proxy. One spray only please. Ugh.",
    "Totally hooked. Can't live my life without my daily fix of Black Sea.",
    "Açılış kimilerine göre itici gelebilir. Adı gibi karanlık aquatic bir parfüm. 5-10 dakika sonra Orta notalara geçildikçe parfümün karakteri yumuşuyor ve daha sevimli bir hale geliyor. Ve 1 saat kadar sonra ise temel notalar hissedilmeye başlıyor ki buradan itibaren çok güzelleşiyor. Parfümün diğer canlandırıcı aquatic parfümlerle hiçbir benzerliği olmadığını bilerek almak gerekiyor. Her gün kullanmak için de yorucu olabileceğini düşünüyorum. Yaz akşamları özel etkinlikleri en ideal kullanım yeri olabilir. Bu gerçek anlamda bir niche parfüm. Tecrübeli olmayan burunlar için itici de olabilir ve kitlesel çekici bir parfüm olduğunu da düşünmüyorum. Şişe almadan önce mutlaka denemeli. Performans daha iyi olamazdı, muhteşem. Koku: 8/10 Versatility: 5/10 Cinsiyet: Bence kesinlikle erkek Uzun ömürlülük: 10/10 Yayılım: 10/10",
    "2 hafta önce gömlek giyerken 3 fıs sıktım. Yıkamaya attım cıkardım astım 2 hafta sonunda bile buram buram kokuyordu aşırı kalıcı",
    "Starts of fresh and aromatic, though I'm not able to get a sense of seaweed or saltiness. The deeper you get into the dry down, the more the freshness subsides and the more the woody and spicy notes dominate the scene. Personally, I find it a bit tiring and not something I would associate with the ocean. The perfume has a decent presence, which is to be expected at extrait concentration and the corresponding pricing.",
    "Although aquatic fragrances are not my favorite scent group, I still enjoy testing them. So far, I've tried Jacques Fath Curacao Bay, Mancera French Riviera, Profumo and Orto Parisi Megamare, and my favorite among these is this one. The salt or perhaps other aquatic notes used in perfumes remind me of men's deodorants... When I first sprayed this on paper, I caught that aggressive scent that I never wanted to inhale and thought, \"I will never be able to use this.\" After an hour, it transformed into an addictive, naturally breezy scent. Cold, dark, but deeply peaceful. No matter how strong it is, it doesn't feel overpowering 🤌",
    "Cheap sunscreen and pool water. 1/10",
    "If you like salty beach marine perfumes this one is definitely for you! It honestly smells very good and projects well too! 8.5/10",
    "Has that common sea salt + algae notes found in Acqua di Sale, Megamere, Armani Bleu Turquoise, Sea Horse etc, but smoothed out and given a mainstream, almost designer-ish twist. I wish it would be much saltier, and less sweet, but I like it. Fantastic performance.",
    "Very potent! Stays on skin and clothes forever. Heavy scent. Suitable for warm and cold weather. Strictly evening wear. Dark clothes. Dark blue. Salt. Algae.",
    "The marriage of Acqua di Sale and Squid in the best sense. It has absolutely nothing to do with the dark depths of Megamare. This is a popular summer sea fragrance with sweet undertones. Amazingly durable and projects beautifully. It's wearable and leans more on the masculine side. 4.8/5",
    "Ok. I have now tested and purchased this. I was afraid that I would get Megamare nr. 2. I don't know why people say this is like Megamare... I have now both... This is like Squid from Zoologist! Nothing like Megamare. This doesn't have the metallic, musky, sharp undertone Megamare has. This is like more... inky, sweet seaweedy and doesn't project like Megamare (but it doesn't need to, since we're talking about an extrait...) This is more like Squid or Bois Flotte from Loccitane. And the iodine note Aqua di Sale has... Well, I can't stand it. Black sea has it but in a small amount only. Some says this is extra masculine, not unisex... Nope! This is more masculine, leaning to unisex. Dark, sweet, nice algae/sea/iodine scent. Not fresh, ... fresh-ish, but more like... calm, ...dark sweet. If it makes any sense. If you don't like Megamare but like more round, sweeter artistic scent, - this is for you!",
    "My favorite perfume for this summer, which also has good chances to be a signature fragrance (for summer :)). In the store I was told „it’s the only one scent for men“ and „a bit harsh fragrance“ and grabbed for it right away. The best solution ever, so it turned to be the best aquatic scent for my nose - salty, waterly, no coconut. A cold sea - like Baltic sea in May or June, but still a sea. Like a person not talking a lot but being the hottest one when close to you.",
    "Is this like Megamare? I have Megamare but I would like to have a more... ozonic, sunshine with open water feeling like 1988 by Rosendo. Without citrusy overtone but also without the ambroxan bomb from Megamare. Which one do you recommend? Arktik or Black? Or... dream sea? Thanks so much, fellow fragfrantics 😊🔥",
    "Definitely one of the most underrated perfumes from this house. Fresh, crisp, bright…it leans a bit masculine (imo), but I still think femms who want to channel their inner mermaid will love this. It’s not necessarily beach-y, but it definitely reminds me of the sea. Like, being on a boat in the middle of the ocean.",
    "I am not a big lover of marine fragrances and therefore this is one of the reviews that IS more difficult to me to write about the Discovery set. Despite not being my favorite perfumes, I have found along the way some that have captivated me like Megamare by Orto Parisi, a marine bomb that lasts all day and projects kilometers; or The Saint mariner by Parfumerie particuliere, a marine perfume full of elegance. However, this perfume has not captivated me. I didn't dislike it either and I think it has enough differentiating elements to not give it a bad grade. Also it is not the typical marine fragrance, but it has much more, but for me it is a \"just good\". Ambergris, musk, salt, orange blossom and moss... That would be the key to this Perfume for me. Within its aquatic and marine charge it also presents a dark and slightly animalic side, probably produced by the mixture of ambergris and musk. The mixture of these notes with moss produces a seaweed-like aroma, green and salty, which extends throughout the duration of the perfume. The performance, as in most perfumes that I have tried from the brand, is quite moderate for being an extrait. A powerful and intense output that immediately descends to a medium projection aroma that lasts for about 6 hours. In my opinion it is not similar to megamare but is more along the lines of a more concentrated Acqua di Gio perfume and subtracts from the citrus part. It is not a fragrance that I would buy but I can recognize the high quality. If you like this type of perfume, do not hesitate to try it, but yes, to avoid frustration and disappointment, do not buy it blindly and keep in mind that: - On many skins, at least mine, the performance is not as good as many say, if what you are looking for is something that lasts a long time and projects intensely, there are other better options. - It is not a typical marine fragrance. The floral, amber and animalic part has a lot of weight to the detriment of the usual citrus part. - It has nothing to do with megamare, so if you like megamare you don't have to like this one or vice versa Perhaps my least favorite of Lorenzo Pazzaglia's marine collection",
    "I regret blind buying this parfume. It smells nice but nothing special. Yes it is similar to Megamare just way more lighter version. People use words like beast, monstrous projection and performance, nuclear longevity etc. Nothing of that. Uniqueness 5 Sillage 7 Longevity 6 Value 6 To me it's not worth it especially if you already have megamre in you collection.",
    "I just received the sample I bought from lucky scent and I’m glad I bought the sample …just to give you an idea this fragrance immediately reminded me of coty musk! Extremely identical ! Coty musk comes off with more alcohol in the beginning. Black Sea is more smoother . I had my girlfriend smell it and she said it had a Vicks vapor rub vibe to it …don’t know what’s wrong with her nose lol .",
    "This fragrance is crazy. It's the best aquatic I've owned and it's performance is monstrous. It is a salty oceanic vibe that has a sort of a piercing quality. Sweetness is absent here and it's not boozy or tropical. It is not Megamare which is more seaweedy. This is more appealing and not redundant of you have or want Megamare. The thing that should make you buy this is it's performance. Chances are if you're looking at this, you're looking for a big time freshie. Here it is. You can find it overseas and recently on Maxaroma. Bravo. Scent: 9 Sillage: 10 Longevity: eternal Uniqueness: 8 Value: 9 Worth it.",
    "Megamare Light. Still a beast just not as deadly.",
    "Very unique take on an aquatic fragrance. It smells truly unique but it is very wearable. The performance on this fragrance is like something I’ve never seen before. If performance is your thing, then you must look at all of Lorenzo’s fragrances. This fragrance will not come off of clothes. It just won’t. And you know what? I freakin love it.",
    "Too screechy and harsh for me. If this is the Black Sea, I'm sure it is Putin's side of it and I'd very much prefer to go with the other 5 basin countries, please.",
    "help, i can't get this off of my jacket! it's been 2 months! still projecting!",
    "I mostly get an overdose of Acqua Di Sale (or a sledgehammer clone of it) over an overdose of Aqua di Gio - lot of amboroxan down there. Not as well blended as its inspirations, dries a bit messily. Had to wash it off before sleep because it just wouldn't quit. I'm a fan of Acqua Di Sale, so I thought I'd like like it for sure but glad I sampled. It's not even cheaper per ml. Just go with the original. Update: I had to change my sheets to get rid of it.",
    "This fragrance is a commitment. It has nuclear longevity. It will be on your skin after a day and a shower, so easy does it on the trigger!! Amazing scent. High quality aquatic. I already wrote a review on how it smells, but I wore it again and my lord the longevity is probably the most out of anything I’ve ever tried. Extract De Parfum",
    "I recently got a sample of Black Sea and also Dream Sea. Both are good fragrances but I prefer this one, possibly because it feels more masculine to me. Dream Sea is sweeter. This is a nice marine scent. It is quite fresh with a subtle sweetness and has a great salty smell in there too. Black Sea does not smell overwhelmingly of seaweed which I’ve seen some people complain of other marine scents. I also think that Black Sea is a very cool and fitting name for this scent. The longevity and Sillage are very strong too. I used only a tiny bit from the 1ml sample with the dabber and could still smell it clearly without getting too close. 50ml bottle of this would definitely last a long while.",
    "Very good Sea collection made Pazzaglia. Recommend to test all his Sea fragrances. But recommend to test it on skin. There is not so much aquatic notes, as you can think. It's not like Megamare, but in such direction. I think it's underrated fragrances of this designer. Black sea - the most iconic in his collection and first fragrance you need to taste. It's the central star of Sea line. Arctic sea it's more cold variation. Dream sea it's more sweet variation. White floral, rose, peppery vanilla scent. Sex sea it's a more sharp, peppery, mossy variation Van Sea it's a combination black+arctic sea+ vanilla. More green, sweet vanilla variation. Recommend to buy all Sea samples to test. It's, i think, great perfumes. Underrated. It's impossible to choose one of them. Every variation it's unique, independent. Recommend to test.",
    "This is probably one of the strongest samples I’ve ever put on my hand. It has some enormous longevity and silage. So much at first you have to wait about 5-10 mins to see what the heck is going on here, but a magnificent aquatic unfolds. Nothing like Nautica voyage aquatic type scents, no this is standing out on the coast of CA on a pier next to a bergamot tree. The ambergris and musk hit hard too. The combo is a very unique aquatic scent that isn’t very sweet. The notes are blended so softly, they all make a special accord and this is a masterpiece aquatic. For me to say that is big, never been a huge fan of the genre. I would 100% but this. Quality is what you would expect from niche. It’s very very potent juice though. I would say this one bottle would last a lifetime. It’s like a 1-2 max spray type scent and people will smell you for sure. This impression is inside my house, I have no experience of how it would do in the sun, prob even better. Love it",
    "no senti mas q ganas de lavarme y quitarmela",
    "Deep sea in the winter, masterpiece by Lorenzo Pazzaglia. Pay attention, it's nuclear",
    "At first it was fresh and green. Then it started smelling more and more like yellow flowers. Not my cup of tea. Definitely a masculine scent.",
    "This perfume reminds me of a stormy sea in winter. The salt permeates the air, the waves overcome the rocks dragging algae and seabed vegetation onto a stony shore. The grit, strength and indomitableness of the stormy sea can be worn thanks to this fragrance. I wear it very often and promptly receive compliments. Easy with the sprays, especially in summer, otherwise, in addition to not being able to take it off, you risk filling entire rooms! It has no equivalent, it has nothing to do with megamare which is more woody or salt water which is a more crystalline, less impetuous sea. Congratulations to Lorenzo Pazzaglia",
    "Just received the perfum from the discovery box. At the first glance you can smell a marine blast with a predominance of the ambergris smell, after 1 hour the ambergris tend to lessen. The perfum is well design and last long for a marine/aquatic scent. Recommend 100%.",
    "The notes looks good thats why i bought it but its a No for me... smells like VapoRub , Mothballs and Naphthalene!",
    "I bought a Luckyscent sample pack of Lorenzo Pazzaglia, and I’m having the same unfortunate reaction to this line as I have with Montale, Mancerra and Ramon Monegal. I’ve never found a perfume from the listed brands that works with my chemistry. Sometimes a perfume is so strong it burns your nostril hairs, as it does with Black Sea. If you are looking for beast mode, you may love this. For me, there’s no subtlety in this composition, no artistic expression in the mix. Yes, I get sea notes, but it’s so overbearing that it’s headache inducing. Juice is also hard to wash off—which may be a good thing if you love it, or a nightmare if you don’t. I will keep an open mind as I sample the remaining line, but my initial voyage is not a good one and it made me Sea Sick. A rare but honest hate vote from me.",
    "To me this is Prada Luna Rosa Carbon + Armani Prive Turquoise Bleu. It leans masculine, but I wear it with pleasure. I wish ambroxan wasn’t there, though.",
    "To be honest, I expected more from this perfume based on the reviews. Longevity and projection are brutal. It's been almost 12 hours since I used 2 sprays on my wrist and it's still aggressive even after it dries. It looks a bit like Invictus to me personally. I also detect a bit of Eros by Versace. Not a blind buy, definitely. Longevity 10/10 Projection 10/10",
    "I Had 4 testers from Lorenzo Pazzaglia and this one is the best. Very nice take on aquatic scent. To me the citrusy-juicy-flowery notes are as strong as the mineral ozonic notes. Algaes are barely noticeable which is great. Longevity and silage are godlike. I did the laundry and my tshirt still smells like Black Sea. Buy it before they reconfigure the ingredients and make it less potent.",
    "Lorenzzo Pazzaglia is going to conquere the parfume world.Every parfume I tried is great.Black sea is great.It is marine scent,but not something we already saw.Aquatic,aromatic,salty,algae,longlasting.Litle bit dark.Great👌",
    "Got the 14 pcs discovery box form Lorenzo. So far i tried few and this is amoung them. It smells different from everything else i tried so far. It has refreshing vibe in it but also smells luxurius & serious. It is not for casual occasions and for younger population. Definitley something related to sea with this perfume. For sure i will have toughts about getting a larger packing of this one.",
    "Black Sea can’t be compared to other perfumes. It’s an incomparable scent that sets my mind on a particular kind scenario :I think of a dark and deep Sea before the Storm . A Marine Woody fragrance , long lasting sillage,compliments are guaranteed.",
    "waoooooo! blind buy this fragrance and was a love at first sniff!!",
    "Very similar to Acqua di Sale, but better priced. If you don’t want to spend the extra cash on Acqua di Sale this is as good, if not better.",
    "Best quality/performance/smell fragrance when it comes to aquatic vibes. 10/10",
    "Absolute kraft",
    "Not only does Black Sea remind me of the ocean.. it's the very EMBODIMENT of the sea itself and everything it has to offer. The user before me mentioned how it's \"THE aquatic\", I couldn't agree more! Truly unlike any other marine out there, I mean just look at the note breakdown, who else is doing that? What a performer too.. I'm speechless...",
    "This is the aquatic. I'm not joking, I smelled a lot of these ones(from Davidoff cool water & Versace Homme back in the days to Xerjoff 40 Knots, Acqua di Sale from Profumum Roma) and I can say that to my nose this is a refined aquatic scent - great projection in the first few hours, however after the salt note fades away (late-heart stage to beginning of the base), the perfume gets closer to skin but it still has character, it still has 80% of that DNA that it had in the beginning - which I have not seen in a lot of aquatics actually. Great value for money and great quality of this scent considering the profile (marine-aquatic). Great job and kudos to Lorenzo Pazzaglia. I cannot wait to test the rest of the discovery kit perfumes. Cheers! Edit 1 : The salty note/vibe persists for around 6-8h on my skin, aswell as a good sillage around that time - but also I cannot truly validate the actual performances of this one - it needs to be tested in a tropical/summer day to find out what it is really capable off. Hats-off anyway",
    "Simply the best fresh/marine scent on the market. With this one you can't go wrong. Fresh but deep too , addictive , longevity and projection are insane. Really. To me this is even more long lasting than megamare. I agree with buzz72, even if this fragrance is often compared to aqua di sale or megamare I can assure you that this is completely different from both of them. This is easy to wear, strong but not annoying. This is the best perfume in this category that I have ever had. I get also a lot of compliments with this one. I don't need another marine scent anymore. This is all that I need during summer ( but you can wear it all year round also). Amazing scent! Good job Lorenzo!",
    "this is very good, marine notes then ambery and turns somewhat powdery in the drydown a bit chanel no 5 like",
    "It is a dark stormy night on the mare adriatico. No lights to be seen, you shut in your cabin by the sea and tend to the fading fireplace. Still, you stick your head outside quick enough to catch a sniff of air full of salt and electricity. Strangely enough, the roaring waves and the uneasy feeling will cradle you in a peaceful slumber, dreaming of dark oceanic depths.",
    "Black Sea by Lorenzo Pazzaglia Black Sea is a transcendental journey into a vortex sea of summer delights. The opening of Black Sea sends you on a white sandy beach surrounded by tropical fruit trees whilst gazing at the infinite sea. Don't think sweet or coconut notes, they are not here. The blend of Black Cypriot Salt in Black Sea is heavy as it's found in the top & middle notes but it's so beautifully done it almost becomes like a creamy texture on your skin after emerging out of the sea water with the ylang ylang, orange blossom and a heavy does of ambergris, Sardinian Myrtle, algae to along with a base note of white musk, patchouli and oakmoss. Utterly hypnotic. The fragrance on skin looks like oil with a whopping concentration of 40%. Longevity and Silage are off the charts but it's so pleasant to wear you almost want to keep it a secret and tell nobody why your skin smells so amazing. Black Sea by Lorenzo Pazzaglia is often compared to Megamare by Orto Parisi or Acqua Di Sale by Profumum Roma. I can assure that Black Sea is a completely different experience from both. I own various aquatics and this one just completely stands out from other aquatic fragrances. It's not overwhelming and is a compliment magnet. Still in doubt? Jack Daniels and Yamazaki 12 year old whiskies both smell of whisky but do I really need to tell you which is the best? 😊 Black Sea is an aquatic Masterpiece for aquatic connoisseurs. Soundtrack to this: Omar: There's nothing like this.",
    "This one is a masterpiece. The salty and marine notes are blended so well with some fruits and Amber notes( after my nose). It start with some salty fruitty marine top and it goes to marine ambery dry down. On my skin it is more than 12 hours of life.",
